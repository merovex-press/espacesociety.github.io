As you can tell, I don't blog on Espace much these days. Most of the visitors head over to the [Astro Empires/](/astro-empires/) guides and pick up a few tips. This site has more than that, and it's about to change.

Since this site started it has been managed with PmWiki. A great tool. Easy to modify. Easy to manage. I've been using PmWiki for nearly a decade. I'll be converting this site to Octopress. That's another way of saying the site will be statically generated. Octopress lets me manage the site pretty much the way I always do. But, static generation gives me a few capabilities I'm looking for at this point.

Over the past year I've been tinkering with Eve Online. You see the section on the top bar. It's a fun game, though a bit of a time hog. One has to have the interest.

Last Fall I published *Scintilla*. I started on *Luctation*, but failed to focus on milieu development. That produced artistic debt that ground the draft to a halt. My son's waxing interest in tabletop role-playing led me to look into Traveller. Traveller and Eve are similar, and both have helped me to develop the Pax Terradoma which is paying down that debt. I hope to resume writing *Luctation* soon.

That's a quick update. I'm always looking for ways to improve the site for the many of you who visit. What are you hoping to find here that you're not?
