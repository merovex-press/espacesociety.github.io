Our effort started in February, 2004 and we took a pause in July 2004. In December 2004, we resumed and this site was built. In January 2005, we began tinkering with a Lexicon called the [Macropedia/Macropedia](/macropedia/macropedia). We weren't sure what to expect, but in the first five months we produced over one-hundred articles detailing the period known as the Imperium. The structure of the Lexicon has helped us keep going.
