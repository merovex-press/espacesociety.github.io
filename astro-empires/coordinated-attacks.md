Initiate
===========

# **Team Formation.** Find players who will join you in an attack and form a team. Four is a good number, as if you take TRs then perhaps each can take one. keep the team small enough to remain coordinated.
# **Research.** All members scout for targets; know your possibilities. Take notes and record a possible list of targets to hit. When possible, use a forum to list your findings.
# **Efficiency.** Look at the [Base Defense Guide](/astro-empires/base-defense-guide) for the bonus expectation for a base. Look to see if the base has adequate defenses per the guide. If so, it is not a target (unless you've another purpose).
# **Debris.** If there is fleet, calculate its derb value, which is about 44 percent its actual value. If you know that player's Armour tech level the derb value is Armour * 2 percent.

Coordinate
==========

When planning attacks, as with all other discussion, timing is critical. Therefore, always use Server Mean Time (SMT) when referring to time events.

As a Team, you must:
# Decide on your target.
# Decide who will strike first.
# Decide who will make the final hit and will receive the pillage.
# If you're going to plunder TRs, agree on how to break out the plunder (all for one, or each takes one).

Plan
========

# **Lay of the Land.** Scout the Target's region and the surrounding regions. Know from where the rival guild might send a harrying force. Know where your guild's bases are in that region and those surrounding it.
# **Sufficient Strength.** Verify that you have the forces to make a successful attack. This typically requires sneaking a Scout to target player's base (not always the target base, but another one with similar fleet) to get the true disposition of his strength.
# **Trash Collection.** Ensure you will have enough RCs on hand to pick up all debris as quickly as possible. Assume total loss of all forces at the highest Armour level. As a rule of thumb, you will need to harvest 88 percent your fleet's value or 44 percent the value of both fleets. That means you need to have 1 RC for every 8.8 credits of your fleet cost. For a 10,000 fleet, that's 8,800, or 880 RCs.
# **Fast Recovery.** Try to harvest the derbs in one tick.
