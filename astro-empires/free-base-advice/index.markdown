I tend to be asked for base advice from various players. My guides tend
to document most of what I espouse. However, here are some tips I tend
to notice I repeat a lot:



Base Spacing
============

Never more than one base per region if you can help it. Never more than
one base in a system.

Metal Rules
===========

Build only on Metal-3 astros. Favor Asteroids or Moons if your upgraded,
Moons or Planets if your Free.

Empire Growth
=============

Build 10 bases in the first week (or as soon after as
possbile); then build one base per month until it's too painful. I tend
to think of pain as: If it takes more than a week to save for a base,
it's too expensive. Based on the table below, that breakpoint is
Base-16.

Defenses
========

Per my [Base Defense Guide](/astro-empires/base-defense-guide), you should get rid of your turrets once
you start building prings. The return on the turrets is usually enough
to pay for your next base; or at least steeply discount it.

Long-Distance Trades
====================

First, you should have at least Spaceport-15 on your bases; once you
have Spaceport-15 and prings and three Dreads overhead, go for
Spaceport-20

If you don't have prings, don't have Long-Distance trades. You're just
adding profit to your attacker. Keep trades under 1000 paces distance.
Once you have prings, don't accept trades under 3000 paces. 

Defend your LD trade with Dreadnaughts. One Dreadnaught per 7,400 paces
in total trades. Just add up your trade distances for an astro, divide
by 7400 and round up.

  <td >3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td >45,200</td>
  <td >(5 x 5400)</td>
  <td >4</td><table class='table'>

Pushing Economy
===============

When you're ready to push economy, either Crystal Mine-10 for your
Asteroids or Econ Center-10 on your other bases.  others should have
Econ Centers.
