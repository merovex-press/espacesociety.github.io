ANCIENT Introduction
============

Nice to meet you and I am happy that you decided to join the Galactic Protection Agency Academy (GPAA)!!! The following information has been compiled through talking to all of the upper ranked players and through frequently asked questions to assist you in quickly understanding this game and how to make the right moves early on. The leadership of the GPAA has one goal and one goal only: To facilitate your success.

Lets start with the basics:

Basic Game Dynamics:
1) This is an economic game. Economy is the way to go. Power is wealth.

2) You cannot ever pass control of a base from one player to another via conquest or gift. This also means you can not pass credits to other players too.

3) You can occupy a base and pillage it. This yields credits, and diminishes the production and building capabilities of the owner.

There is a Newbie guide that walks you through the initial steps of building your empire. It is located at http://forum.astroempires.com/viewtopic.php?t=11626

This is a great guide and following it will enable you to develop several hundred econ an hour quite quickly. Please follow this guild. Only a few things need to be changed. By the forth day make sure your planets go up to 10 spaceports. The extra trade route per planet is worth the extra money dished out. In addition to this guide I would like to share with you some insight on your first couple of days of playing.

Fundamentals to Know:

1) You are protected for 7 days from attack.

2) You will not be attacked or lose your home base during this time.

3) Focus on the starter guide for building up your starting base. Always refer to this until you reach your 10th planet.

4) Focus on  when selecting what to build and in what order. Choose the build option that generates the most income for the least amount of expenditure. This means switch building types as you progress. Do not build the same structure 5 times in a row. Alternate. Speed is important in the beginning not the level of the structure. Look for economic worlds for your first three colonized bases. The limiting factor mid-to-late game is space and fertility. Asteroids are great short-term revenue makers, but the lack of space makes them hard to improve. Conversely, the ability to protect a base in late game is based upon the planetary shielding, which is extremely expensive, and is much less expensive when on an asteroid.

5) Day 7: At each of your bases have at least the following:
100 Fighters
3 Cruisers
2 of the most advanced turrets available to level 2 (10/10).

6) Your Key Production bases should have an additional 100 Fighters and an extra Cruiser.

7) Day 10: Have a level of above 10.0

8) Day 20: Have a minimum econ of 250

9) Day 35: Have a minimum level of 20.0

10) Specialization is key!

11) NAP = Non Aggression Pact. This means you do not attack them

12) KOS = Kill on Spot. This means any time you see this player you are encouraged to attack.

13) Ceti is a very dangerous place. Without making alliances or NAP the larger guilds will just pick off the smaller guilds. These NAPs allow us some protection. However they may turn on us in the future, we do NOT under any circumstance do the first move. This just means that you should always be on your guard and try to be friends with our NAPs so we can further our progress and relationship with these other guilds.

1) Do not attack them
2) If there is a problem first thing you do is message a diplomat, guild master or commander and chief.
3) Only under his permission do you take any action.
4) More experienced players are willing to help you out so just ask them for advice if you have any questions

13) Even though you are protected under newbie protection for the first 7 days, you still need to protect your trade routes because they can be pillaged. To prevent this is easy. All you need to do is build one fighter on all your bases and this can be prevented until the 7th day when your protection disappears.

14)acces (m) = minutes that have gone by since you have lefted a post on the message board or done anything active on AE

Ergo:

Conquest and occupation will only give you limited income, and the cost to occupy a base is often more expensive that what you receive from it. Especially true if the base owner has invested in command centers. Each Galaxy has a Galactic Commander, who is responsible for coordination in that galaxy. Without his or her help, protection and liberation of players would not be possible. In order to protect yourself and to better your benefit your play in AE we need the following information from you.

1) The location of all your bases

2) The fleet of your bases

3) any other guilds in the area of your base that are a threat and are not NAPs

4) Guild commanders always report there orders in announcements so always read the red tab announcements

5) Sightings of unusually strong players outside of our guild that you have seen, both independent and in other guilds.

6) Your thoughts on what challenges you are currently facing. We are here to help you so either post your problems in the message board under general or talk to your guild commander

7) Post any new trade routes in the trades tab. Always post the location of your base with the free trade route, the current econ for the astro (planet) and the desired galaxy you want your trading partners in.

8) Your thoughts on what players and guilds are possible threats to your success and be prepared to discuss options on how to mitigate these threats.

9) Progress reports to your galaxy commander about fleet developments, technology and attack fleets.

10) When you join message the commander that you are in the same galaxy with. Cxx The first two xs are the galaxy you are in. They will need your base location and what fleet you have at that location.

What You Can Expect from Guild Leadership: (commander/ Professors/ People in Charge):

1) Information. Lots of information.

2) A willing ear to discuss options on how to help you reach your goals.

3) A big brother in a bad neighborhood that will go to great lengths to insure that together we will all be successful.

4) When you join message the commander that you are in the same galaxy with. Cxx The first two xs are the galaxy you are in. They will need your base location and what fleet you have at that location.

Newbie Build Goals
==================

1) Day 5: Turn your attention to preparing the defense of your bases.

2) Day 7: At each of your bases have at least the following:
100 Fighters
3 Cruisers
2 of the most advanced turrets available to level 2. This mean 10/10 on the top 2 turret classes you have

3) Your Key Production bases should have an additional 100 Fighters and an extra Cruiser.

4) Day 10: Have a level of above 10.0

5) Day 20: Have a minimum econ of 250

6) Day 35: Have a minimum level of 20.0

Trade Routes
============

Trade is normally 30 to 50 percent of your income. That means trade is
important. As a general goal, by day 7 you should have 11&ndash;12 income
from each route. The table below shows why 15 spaceports is an ideal
goal for each base. The trade formula has a multiplier which emphasizes
trading at a distance with as many other players as possible. With this
knowledge in hand, you should easily draw half your income from trade.

<table class='table'>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td >Spaceports</td>
  <td >1</td>
  <td >5</td>
  <td >10</td>
  <td >15</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td >Trade Routes</td>
  <td >1</td>
  <td >2</td>
  <td >3</td>
  <td >4</td><table class='table'>


<dl><dt>Trade Route Formula</dt><dd></dd>
<dt></dt><dd></dd>
</dl>

This formula reveals two important points based on the multiplier.
First, the number of unique players you trade with increases the value
of all you trade routes. For example, if you trade with 9 people, you
trade multiplier is increased by 0.3. If you trade with 16 people, the
multiplier is increased by 0.4. Second Distance is important. If you
managed to find a trade route 5625, the multiple would be 1. A route
distance of 1000 is a multiplier of 0.42. Combined, that means that
a trade route of 1000 for a player with 16 unique trading partners has a
trade multiplier of 0.82. With 36 unique partners, that is a multiplier
of 1.02.

When you first start out, trading with yourself is okay. You may have
difficulties finding trading partners. However, you use two trade routes
to net the same profit you would have if each route were shared with a
different partner. The distinction is that you have fewer unique
partners and your trade multiplier is reduced.


Moving Fighters Using Hanger Based Ships
========================================

1) Choice the fleet your fighters and hanger ready ships are

2) Hit move button under the location "planet name" (Cxx:xx:xx:xx)

3) Hit the max button on the ships you want to have fighters to go in

4) Hit hanger infront of the bomber/fighters you want docked

5) Or you can type in the number of fighters you want in the hangers that are less then the max amount

6) It should have a (-) in light black what fighters are in hangers and a white number where the fighters are in ships that are hanger ready

7) Then you copy and paste your destination in the destination box, on the lower right you use your bookmarks, or lower left your base locations

Planet Layout
-------------

A major consideration is specializing planets and optimizing production,
economy and research. The following table presents decent long-term
goals for each of your bases. Be mindful that this is a guideline and
your unique situation may require a different layout. For example, if
you managed to build on an Oceanic world, the value of Metal Refineries
is a waste of space.

Planet Choice
-------------

These are good pros and cons for each type of planet (astro). The
general consensus for planet choices are the following:

Each astro has different trades that make them better for certain
specializations. The general consensus on Astro Empires is to specialize
the following planets:

* Research: Earthly, Arid, Tundra, Gaia
* Economy: Asteroid, Crystalline
* Production: Rocky, Crater, Metallic

The best worlds are: slot 2 crystal moons/planet, any crystal
moon/planet, and slot 2 asteroids. Why? Slot 2 (CXX:XX:XX:2X) worlds have
a boost to fertility. Slot 1 worlds have more solar energy, but the
fertility boost reduces the number of Urban Structures you need. This is
more important as there are alternatives to Solar Plants. Generally, a
moon is prefered to a planet. While the planet has more area to build,
it costs twice as much to defend in the long term. Area can be increased
via Terraforming and other technologies. Defense costs by astro type
(i.e. moon or planet) is fixed.


Newbie Attack Fleet
===================

* 4000 Fighters (FT)
* 100 Carriers (CA)
* 100 Cruisers (CR)
* 20 Heavy Cruiser (HC)

<div class='bs-callout bs-callout-info'>
Note: 10 bases should have the following defense use the formula @@econ * 12@@ to determine fighter defense. With 100 econ there should be a fighter screen of 1200 fighters (12 fighters per 1 point of economy). These goals take time so don't be frustrated keep at it.
</div>

Next:

When you hit 1200 fighters build 5 cruisers to 1 heavy cruiser till you
get 100 cruisers/20 heavy cruisers on all your bases...then build the
remaining 800 fighters on all your bases so you have 2000 fighters a
base. Then build 10 battleships and 1 dreadnaught. Ideally you want at
least 1250 econ so you can build 25 fighters an hour per base...10
bases. Always keep the ratio when adding to this as 60 fighters to 1
carrier to 10 cruisers to 5 heavy cruisers to 1 battleship.  
Eventually, your defense fleet (and a good base attack fleet) for all
bases should be:

**Attack Fleet**

* 2000 fighters
* 50 carriers
* 200 recyclers
* 200 cruisers
* 20 heavy cruisers
* 10 battleships
* 1 dreadnought

**Base Defense Fleet**

* 2000 fighters
* 100 cruisers
* 40 heavy cruisers
* 5 battleships
* 1 dreadnought

Always add to this by using this ratio:

* 400 fighters (1 fleet carrier)
* 20 cruisers
* 5 heavy cruisers
* 1 battleship
* 0.2 dreadnought
