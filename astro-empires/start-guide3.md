This is a Step-by-step guide, read-as-you-play guide. Meaning if you've got no idea how to play, this is the guide for you.

Well, you've signed up right? It's probably a good idea to check what kind of planet you've started on before proceeding further.

Click on Empire, then click on Home Planet. You'll see this on the left side:

Astro Type:
Terrain:
Area:
Solar Energy:
Fertility:

The astro type really doesn't matter if it's a moon or a planet, both have their quirks and drawbacks, but what you should be focusing on is Terrain and Solar Energy. If the terrain isn't Rocky or Crystalline and the Solar Energy isn't 3, reregister and see what you get this time. If you get the requirements, then you can proceed with the rest of the guide.

Now, once you've got your desired planet, click on Structures, then click Build next to Metal Refineries. After that, scroll down until you see a Construction Queue. Queue up items in this order:

Metal Refineries
Metal Refineries
Solar Plant
Metal Refineries
Metal Refineries if you have 6 Fertility, Urban Structures if you have 5.

All in all, this will take about an hour or so to finish, so let's now get on with the basics. Read fast or your queues will empty themselves out.

Now, you might want to know why this demanded such a specific starting planet. Here's the answer.

Astro Type - Can be one of 3 options; Planet, Moon, or Asteroid. One of the main things this does is change how much area an astro can have. Asteroids have 65 area by default, you won't see any other empty asteroids with different area values. Planets always have more area than Moons. The amount varies depending on what type of astro it is. Another useful thing is that some buildings and defenses' costs vary depending on what kind of Astro Type it is. For example, Planetary Rings cost 50,000 Credits to build on a planet. However, they cost half that amount to build on a moon, and half of that to build on an asteroid. Which is actually a very useful thing.

Terrain - Has lots of different options, however, few are actually good.

Area - This is obvious, it tells you how much stuff you can put on your base.

Solar Energy - This is dictated by which orbital the astro is in. But we'll leave that part alone for now. This basically is the value of how much energy your solar plants bring in at base value.

Fertility - This tells you how much population your Urban Structures give.

Metal - This is the value that your Metal Refineries give to your Construction and Production values for that base.

Gas - This is an alternative to solar plants, if this is a positive value, then you can build Gas Plants, which provide an alternative source of energy.

Crystal - This is a purely economic value, if this is a positive value, then you can build Crystal Mines, which give you more economy.

By now, your queues should be close to done if you're a slow reader, in which case, queue up a Research Lab, then a Solar Plant, then a Spaceport, and a Shipyard.

Now let's take a look at the right side. Here you have Construction, Production, Research, Economy, and Owner Income.

Construction - This affects how fast you can build structures and defenses.

Production - This affects how fast you can build ships.

Research - This affects how fast you can research technology.

Economy - This is the total amount of Credits this planet is bringing in, excluding trade route income.

Owner's Income - This is the amount of Credits this planet is bringing in right now, it will be lowered if the base is successfully attacked and occupied.

Once the Research Lab is done, start researching Computer, and queue up another Computer and 4 Energy. And queue another metal refinery and a spaceport.

Now I'm going to explain the method behind my madness.

The reason why I'm ordering such a precise method is because this is the most efficient, and the fastest way to make your empire grow. My personal record for grabbing the second planet was about a day and a half.

Now, the way I queue things, I look at the costs. Whatever costs the least, I put into queue first. For example, lvl 4 Metal Refineries cost as much as lvl 1 spaceports and lvl 1 shipyards. Specifically, I like to put queues in this order:

Metal Refineries (To up the construction speed)
Spaceports (To up the economy)
Robotics Factories (To up the construction speed)
Shipyards (You'll need this later on at lvl 8 anyway)

Sometimes you'll notice that you can't queue anything other than Urban Structures, Solar Plants, or Gas Plants. When you see these three options only, it means that you need to put a plant in queue because you'll run out of energy by the time the queue gets up to it. If you only see Urban Structures, that means by the time the queue gets there, you'd have run out of population. So queue them only when this happens, because otherwise you're just wasting time and credits.

Oh, and speaking of Robotics Factories, if your second level of Computer finished researching, you've just unlocked those. It' best that you make your queues so that spaceports, shipyards, and robotics factories are all the same level. Add your research queues so that when it's done, you'll be up to Energy 6. Also, try to get level 2-3 research labs up in between queues.

The way you gain credits in this game, which is the line of currency, is to up your economy. Every hour, you gain credits according to your total economy, not of a single planet, but of your whole empire. To view your total economy, click Empire, then Economy. You'll find it at the bottom. So if you're good at calculating time, try to slip in a spaceport if you find it'll finish in time before the hour.

Now, depending on how active you are, and how much sleep you're willing to lose, it may take you 2-3 days to obtain your second base. If you've started in the morning and can hang around until you have to go to sleep, you'll probably make it within 36 hours like I did. However, this is only for the crazy people who want to make full use of their 7 day upgraded account. It is possible, while in this state and timeframe, to obtain 10, even 11 planets, if you are active enough. After this upgrade expires, your account becomes a free account, and the maximum amount of planets you can get is 9. Also, if you'd like, you can rush Terraform, which free accounts can only upgrade to level 5. My best shot at this was getting Terraform to level 9 on 3 bases. While you may lose sleep over it, if you're a freak and want an unfair advantage in this game, this will help you out a lot later on.

By now, your queues should be just about done. And if it's already night time for some of you people and you want to get some sleep, now would be a good chance to take advantage of the sleeping hours and throw the queueing efficiency rule out the window. Queue as many spaceports as you can. Don't worry about the research, I doubt you sleep for 14 hours until the queue empties out. However, if you're still going strong, then ignore this.

Well, you know the basics of queueing, so this is basically what you should have by the end of day 1.

8 Metal Refineries
4 Robotics Factories
4 Shipyards
4 Spaceports

And when you go to sleep for the night, make sure you get 5 research labs done by tomorrow, because the next phase of stuff is about to begin. And for the sleepy people that just woke up, get this done and read down.

By now, you should've gotten lvl 6 Energy. You also might notice that your're probably a little short on credits right now. So basically, you'll have to just queue stuff up and wait for the hours to roll by. So I suggest either grabbing a drink and your favorite book/game/friend and get busy, because this'll be a slow day. If you managed to get the above before going to bed, however, you should have plenty of credits on hand and should be able to run at full speed.

So what now? Well, if you've gotten lvl 5 Research labs up and finished lvl 6 Energy, you'd have unlocked Stellar Drive. You'll need to research this to lvl 4. Do so, and quickly. And queue up more Energy until you get it to lvl 8.

Meanwhile, it's back to queueing structures. You'll want to have lvl 8 shipyards and lvl 8 research labs in the end, however, so if you're running a bit short on time and there's competition for the planets you're looking to grab, I would allow letting the efficiency rule slide here.

Once your queues are full, it's time for you to explore more parts of this game. When I was talking about grabbing the second planet when all you see is yours, I wasn't kidding. Click on Empire, click the base coordinates (CXX:XX:XX:xx), and then click System xx.

You'll now have a good view of what your base's solar system looks like. It might be totally empty except for your base, or it could be full of planets, asteroids, moons, and gas giants. I guess I should explain these too.

Astros with - empty - under them means that no one has claimed the astro, and is free for the taking. However, Gas Giants and Asteroid Belts are deemed unclaimable, and in addition, you will not be able to move fleets over them. Now, while your queues are running, would be a good time to start picking out some nice astros to take for your next base. Because one way or another, you're getting your next base today.

Now hold on here. You don't just want to go colonizing the whole system here and think, oh this will be a really easy way to defend my empire, right? Wrong. You're more like a fish in a barrel, just waiting to be gutted. It's a good idea to get out of the system, so click on Region xx.

You'll now see a small portion of the galaxy. Depending on where you are, you may see a lot or a little of solar systems. The white coordinated one is the one your base is in. Click on the others and check them out. Refer to the Terrain to pick out what base you want next. It's also not such a great idea to choose all your bases to be in the same region, it's best to pick 2 or 3 and move on to the next region.

You can look into the neighboring regions by clicking on the blue arrows, but you won't be able to see the systems. So we'll leave that alone for now.

Your queues should be close to finished, and depending on when you started, it's either afternoon or night time. If you need to sleep now, queue Warp Drive and fix your queues if you didn't have the time to get to this:

12 Metal
8 Robotics
8 Shipyards
8 Spaceports
8 Research Labs

8 Energy
4 Stellar

If you're still going, then once Warp Drive finishes, and you've got 8 Shipyards, go to Production. You'll now see that you've unlocked Outpost Ships. These are what will get you your next planet. It costs 100 Credits per, so you'll have to save up. If you've got the credits already, build 1. Not 2, not 3. 1. You'll also want to queue up 2 Scout Ships to explore neighboring regions. Build these separately, as building them together as a pack will take longer to finish both at the same time.

Once the Outpost Ship finishes, you'll need to send it over to the astro you want to claim. To do this, click on Fleet, then click Fleet 1 (Which is the current fleet name), click Move, and input the coords of the astro you want to move to, input 1 for the Outpost ship, and click Move. Make sure you've got the coordinates right. Depending on how far away it is, it'll take you a few hours to move it.

Once the Outpost Ship lands, click on Fleet, Fleet 1, then Build Base. This will cost you 50 credits to establish. Now you may input this new base's name.

Well, you know what to do with this planet now. The exact same thing as the other one, except don't build Research Labs on this one. If it's got crystals on it, you can build a couple of crystal mines on it for the economy boost as well. Once the Spaceport on this base is done, click on Trade, and click on your first base's coordinates, then confirm it to set up a trade route. This adds to your economy. Make sure you set this up for all your bases.

But by this time you'll probably need to go to sleep. Queue up a couple of Outpost Ships after you've established your base, as many as you can, and finish up the queues. If you've already finished the requirements above, then start building research labs up to level 12, and research Computer up to lvl 6, as well as Laser lvl 2. If you've just woken up, then get all this done.

Now, your credits should be rolling in. And your scouts should be done too. Select a random location in the neighboring regions and move your scouts there. 1 scout for each region. Start grabbing more bases, but don't grab too many in the same area. Let your scouts find some more suitable locations. Meanwhile, build up your second base.

Also, you'll want to start researching technology until you've got this:

Energy 10
Computer 10
Laser 8
Armour 2
Missle 1
Stellar Drive 4
Warp Drive 1

Time constraints shouldn't really matter from this point on, you've got all the basics down, and all you have to do now is grab more planets until you can't anymore, and build them up. A couple things to take note of first though.

Energy 10 and Computer 10 gives you Terraform. Terraform is a valuable structure that expands your base's area by 5. Computer 10 also gives you Economic Centers, which are valuable in getting your economy up. Computer 10 with Laser 8 gives you Nanite Factories, which will help your Construction and Production rate.

Also, by the 6th day, it is highly recommended that you start building defenses. Build Laser Turrets and Missle Turrets. 1 level of each as a basic defense is fine. Anything extra is now up to you.
