Calculating Opponent's Technology Level
=======================================

To calculate your opponent's technology, the obvious solution is to
divide a unit's Power by the standard power level for a unit of that
type, subtract 1 and multiply by 20. This yields the tech level of that
unit's weapon. Armour is done the same way, although if there are
fighters, there is an easier way (see below).

**Armour.** To determine your opponent's armor level. Subtract two
from his Fighter's Armor level and multiply by ten. This is his Armor
Tech rating. For example, an opponent has a Fighter Armor of 3.7.
Subtracing 2 gives you 1.7. Multiplying by 10 gives you 17.

**Laser.** Again, subtract two and multiply by ten the Fighter's
Power. The example above with an opponent of 3.9 would have a Laser of
19.

**Plasma.** Divide the Cruiser's power by 24 (or HC by 48), subtract 1
and multiply by 20.
