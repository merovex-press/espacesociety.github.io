Welcome to Ben Wilson's (a.k.a. Merovech)
[Astro Empires](http://www.astroempires.com) guides.



Introduction
==========

Merovech, author of these guides, started playing in August of 2007 and as of
Spring 2011 has played on Ceti, Delta,
Epsilon, Fenix Gamma, Helion and Ixion.  Early on, he listened to the advice of other players, which
made him make some bad decisions.  He decided to challenge the accepted wisdom
of other players by looking at the underlying mechanics. These guides are the
result of some of his findings. He encourages you to find him out in-game to
let him know where his advice has fallen short.

1. **Experiment.** Don't take anything for granted from anyone or anything, including this site. Science doesn't matter, results do. Be open minded, read everything and find what works by experimenting.
1. **Master Your Fears.** You'll be intimidated first time. Don't fear failure, learn from it. Do what pushes you out of your comfort zone. Your self-confidence will increase.
1. **Believe.** Listen to those who have walked the path before you. You can achieve anything you want if you copy what they do. Aim high with your goals and believe in yourself. If they can do it, you can do it.
1. **Persist.** How long it takes you to achieve your goals doesn't matter, as long as you achieve them. Focus on the long-term. Never give up until you are where you want to be.
1. **Keep it Simple.** Forget about the details. Focus on the big picture. The most effective way to achieve your goals is often the simplest approach. Stick with what's proven to work, don't reinvent the wheel.

Base Construction Guides
========================

These are a few of a popular guides that discuss the art of building a decent base.

Ten Bases in Seven Days
-----------------------

[The Seven-Ten Guide](/astro-empires/the-ten-seven-guide) describes an optimized
path to building ten bases in the first week of game play. This guide
was developed prior to Astro Empire's modification of protection during
the first week. AE changed the mechanics because free players were able
to use guides like this to build ten bases&mdash;thereby circumventing the
nine-base limit. What AE should have done is allow free players to have
ten bases.

Having validated this guide during the Helion startup, I can say the
guide works provided you keep an eye on your level progression and
ensure you have adequate defenses. If your neighbors are at least five
levels above you, this guide is ideal.

Advanced Base Guide
-------------------

My [Advanced Base Guide](/astro-empires/advanced-base-guide) came with
[analysis](/astro-empires/advanced-base-guide-analysis) on the optimal layout of an
astro. This started with common wisdom and validating the accuracy of
those assumptions. This guide retains some of the original common wisdom
that has not been fully evaluated. This guide includes recommended
structure goals for "free players," those who do not pay to play. Those
structure goals assume a "fully terraformed" astro (five-levels of
terraform).

Very Advanced Structures
------------------------

The [Very Advanced Structures](/astro-empires/very-advanced-structures) guide expands on the advice given in
the Advanced Base Guide by discussing structures encountered through
heavy reasearch (e.g. Multi-Level Platforms, Planetary Rings). It builds
on the "fully terraformed" advice by showing what could be done with
Multi-Level Platforms to give the free player the most enjoyment out of
his bases.

Production Structures Chart
---------------------------

For a quick reference, I put together a [Production Structures](/astro-empires/production-structures) chart.
This simply organizes the various manufacturing and production
facilities based on their relative cost. As players like to build bases
with these structures cost-balanced, this chart provides a quick means
to assess construction goals.

Combat Guides
================

These are some popular guides on combat.

Small Fleet Doctrine
--------------------

[Small Fleet Doctrine](/astro-empires/small-fleet-doctrine) is an analysis of efficient fleet design. The
core tenant is that a player should focus on building fleets that are
efficient against other fleets. This assumes that one knows the target,
which means the player has to be somewhat aggressive to really pull it
off. Some players assert that "blob" combat makes Small Fleet untenable.
I contend that it only requires that players work together to build an
efficient blob.

Base Defense Guide
------------------------------

My [Base Defense Guide](/astro-empires/base-defense-guide) offers a profit-based defense theory to game play.
Operating under the philosophy that Astro Empires is essentially an economics
game, this guide advises players on base defenses that help reduce their bases'
profit-profile.

Efficiency Ratios
------------------------------

I created a [Efficiency Ratios](/astro-empires/efficiency-ratios) chart that provides the armor efficiency
ratio of the various units. The ratio is the unit's armour divided by its
costs. The philosophy this ratio follows is that a combatant will bring enough
fleet do be effective against the opponent, and the remaining derbs will be
harvested by the player.

Back of Napkin Combat
--------------------

The [Napkin Combat](/astro-empires/napkin-combat) guide discusses how to run a fairly efficient attack
without relying on a battle calculator. The first section describes how to
attack in waves. The second section provides a couple rules of thumb that help
calculate how many units to bring.

Battle Calculators
-------------

I was never much of a fan of them, but a lot of people ask me about [Battle Calculator](/astro-empires/battle-calculator)s.

Whither Thou Death Star
------------------------------

The [Whither Thou Death Star](/astro-empires/whither-thou-death-star) guide is more of a narrative on the Death Star.
I don't have much experience with one, but discuss various points to consider
if you decide to build one.

Scouting
-------

[Scouting](/astro-empires/scouting) is perhaps a dangerous option.
