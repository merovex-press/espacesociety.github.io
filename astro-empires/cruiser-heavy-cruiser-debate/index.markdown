This article addresses a debate I heard between a Cruiser Fleet and a
Heavy Cruiser Fleet. As one may gather from my [Small Fleet Doctrine](/astro-empires/small-fleet-doctrine),
I prefer Cruiser Fleets as the _core_ of any combat fleet.

Both fleets use Fighters. Cruiser Fleets build a mix of Cruisers and
Carriers. Heavy Cruiser Fleets build a mix of Heavy Cruisers and Fleet
Carriers. Casual familiarity with each combination shows the speeds
match. Both fleet sets value Laser and Plasma as the core Power
technologies.

Efficiencies of the Fleets
==========================

Cruisers are marginally [more efficient](/astro-empires/efficiency-ratios) than Heavy
Cruisers.
