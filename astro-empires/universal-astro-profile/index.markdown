One difficult task in Astro Empires is capturing the details of a base and reporting those details in an easy to read format. To remedy this, a 10-character code was developed called the **Universal Astro Profile**  (UAP).  The idea for the profile derives from the role-playing game, Traveller, which solved the problem of universal description of characters, vehicles and places using a series of universal profiles.



The Code Explained
==================

The basic format of the code is [@ 0APPB-0BBB0 @]. In this notation, '0'
is decimal, 'A' is a letter, 'P' is a specific code, and 'B' is Base 34.


<table class='table'><tr>
  <td>Slot</td>
  <td>Which orbit the base is in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>A</strong></td>
  <td>Type</td>
  <td>The astro type. See table below for mapping between astro type and code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>P</strong></td>
  <td>Production</td>
  <td>The largest unit type it can produce, in two-letter code. See table below for mapping.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>P</strong></td>
  <td>Capacity</td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>B</strong></td>
  <td>Occupation Value</td>
  <td>Hourly revenue from occupation in tens of credits (dekacredits).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>-</strong></td>
  <td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>0</strong></td>
  <td>P-Rings</td>
  <td>Number of P-Rings on the base.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>B</strong></td>
  <td>Shields</td>
  <td>D-Shields [0-9] or P-Shields [A-J].</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>B</strong></td>
  <td>Turrets</td>
  <td>Photon [0-9] or Disrupter [A-J] Turrets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>B</strong></td>
  <td>Command Centers</td>
  <td>Number of Command Centers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><strong>0</strong></td>
  <td>Jump Gates</td>
  <td>Number of jump gates.</td>
</tr>
</table>

Explanation of Base34 and codes is offered below. However, a translation
of the code may help explain it until I figure out how to explain it
myself. The following is an astro entry: [+[@5KHC4-1ABA3@]+] Based on this entry, we know the following:
* (5) The slot is 20.
* (K) The type is Rocky.
* (HC) The base can produce Heavy Cruisers.
* (4) The base generates 40 credits per hour during occupation.
* (1) The base has one P-Ring.
* (A) The base has one P-Shield. If it was a Deflection Shield, it woudl be 1 instead of A.
* (B) The base has two D-Turrets. If it was Photon turrets, it would be 2 instead of B.
* (A) The base has ten Command Centers
* (3) The base has Jump-Gate 3.

From reviewing the attributes of the UAP, you may notice this helps
quickly note value of the base and its inherent defenses.

What is Base34?
===============

Base 34 is an extension of Base16 which lets us use a single digit as
much as possible. Here is a mapping between Base34 and decimal.

Color Coding
============

The Census uses color coding for key defense values. The color code is based on the best-practices in base defenses learned from the older galaxies. Specifically, UAP color coding assumes the following defenses as ideal&mdash;and are colored <span class='text-success'>green</span> in the UAP:

* Planetary Rings (2)
* Planetary Shields (2)
* Disrupter Turrets (3)
* Command Centers (15)

A minimal acceptable value is also present, and colored <span class=''>blue</span>. Any other value is colored <span class='text-danger'>red</span>.

* Planetary Rings (1)
* Planetary Shields (1)
* Disrupter Turrets (2)
* Command Centers (10)
