This page summarizes the advice given in [the Ten Seven Guide](/astro-empires/the-ten-seven-guide), with some information brought over from the [Advanced Base Guide](/astro-empires/advanced-base-guide).

**Base Build Order.** This is considered to be a good build order for bases, if you are specializing. The early goal is to boost your economy, with an eye to production toward the end of the first week.



**Recommended Astros.** The following are the recommended astros. The preferred is Slot-1 or Slot-2, with the exceptions subscripted. If you are playing a free account, favor Planets. If an upgraded account, favor moons. Asteroids are the ideal choice all around, when upgraded.



**Base Quota.** This table provides goals for building your empire to get to ten bases. The econ row shows what your empire's economy needs to be (on average) that day to afford the bases needed. The levels shows what the probable minimum level of your empire will be.


**Construction Goals.** The following construction goals help keep the empire growing through the week, so it will be ready to stand its ground.


**Research Goals.** These are the critical technologies needed to be able to build new bases.The parentheses show how many Research Labs you need to research that technology.


**Defense Standards.** These are the defenses required for given base economy levels, with required number of first-week offensive units. Values good only for the first two weeks of game play.
