This is a diary of one run through the Ten-Seven Guide. This diary
originally began as an objective test of [the Ten Seven Guide](/astro-empires/the-ten-seven-guide), which
began on October 16, 2007 (Tuesday morning).  What follows is a more
detailed listing of how Ben Wilson applied the guide to local
conditions. He started on a Slot 2 Arid Moon. You are supposed to start
on a Rocky, Crater or Metallic.  Since Arid is optimal for Research, he
broke with the normal dogma and decided the first base would be pure
Research. The consequence is a loss of one Metal, but an increase in
Fertility.



Your base will start with one Urban Structure and one less than the
normal Solar Plant output.

Ben lost four hours productivity because of sleep. However,
the banked credits were quickly expended. By the last hour, he was
strapped financially again. So, the queues served their purpose and
incidental lost time was not relevant.

Notes
-----

Try to focus on building the Shipyards and Research Labs over Factories and
Refineries. That helps you produce your Scouts and Outposts. For a
slightly slower but cheaper reconnaisance force, research Laser and
Armour and build two Corvettes.

Ben failed to attain the goals in Metal Refineries and Robotics Factory
by two each. However, he sprinted ahead and reached Shipyard-8 early. He
also developed scouting ability early by using Corvettes instead of
Scout Ships. This allowed him to identify a Crystalline Moon (orbiting a
Gaia Planet) in a freshly developed region that he hopes to start his
first Commerce base on early in Day 3.

Day Three

Base Actions
------------

Planting the second base early on Day Three was rewarding. Violating the
order a bit, Ben chose to capture the Crystaline Moon and Gaia Planet.
This satisfies one of his Commerce base and his second pure Research
base objectives. As the System was occupied, Ben chose to deny a future
rival both rare finds. This puts him behind in establishing Commerce
bases, all three of which should be built today. Both bases were
established one Region South of his home Region.

Once the second base was established, the play-by-play became harder to
describe, so Ben abandoned it. On the Crystal Moon, he focused on
building Crystal Mines instead of Research Labs but otherwise followed
the original three-day build quota. This allowed him to ramp up his
economy. He also established his first Spaceport early to start trade
with the first base and add a little more to the economic engine. By the
end of Day-3, the base economy was XX.

The third base was another Crystal Moon, and he likewise followed the
pattern. By the end of Day-3, the base economy was XX.

**Not Yet.** The Gaia Planet is focusing only on building up its
Production ability at first. The objective is to establish the foothold
and ensure defenses can be built on Day Six. Once the production
capacity is developed, then focus shifted to barebones Research
capacity.

Trade
-----

Ben also established trade routes within the empire, which is a bad idea
long term. However, for 13 credits, he started earning 12cr/hr between
his first and second base. He continued to build five Spaceports on the
other two bases to allow all three bases to trade together. The trade at
the end of the day was 26 credits. The total imperial economy was 118
per hour. This allowed Ben to fill his Construction queues and begin
production of 3 Outpost Ships at the beginning of Day 4.

Day Four
========

Ben fell behind on base construction, having only built 2 new bases on
Day Three; instead of the four base goal. However, at the beginning of
Day Four, he dispatched his third Outpost Ship to his third Commerce
planet (an asteroid). Scouting with his Corvette, he was also able to
identify two Production base locations (Rocky and Crater) by the end of
Day Three. He also identified two Gaia planets for potential Research
use.

After establishing the third new base (four of ten), he built a research
base on a Gaia Planet (5 of 10). During the middle of Day Four, he
established his first Production base (Rocky Planet). At the end of Day
Four, he established his second Production base (Craters Moon, 7 of 10).
Thus, while starting the day at a one base deficit, he ended the day
with a one base surplus.

Day Five
========

Day Five began with Ben working on improving his newer two bases.  He
also built more infrastructure on the older five bases, although he has
still not fully satisfied the construction goals of any of the
bases&mdash;except for Crystal Mines. He let his queues die down after the
first quarter of Day Five, and built his last three Outpost Ships. Over
the next two days, he must amass 22400 credits to reach the final goal.
With trade, his present economy is 380, which means he has to
improve his economy to at least 470 credits per hour. To accomplish this
solo, he is building towards ten Spaceports per base. This should
improve his economy by 70-105 credits per hour.

With three hours remaining in Day 5, Ben established his eighth base.
This keeps him on schedule to complete the ten bases. His economy is
500, which suggests that his income is sufficient to build the two
bases. To help ensure success, Ben started building Goods (3 per hour at
one base) to help defray the construction costs on this newest base.

The remaining two bases have already been scouted out, and are in
different regions than the other bases. Ben placed the production bases
generally where they could help the non-production bases with fleet
production.

Day Six
=======

Ben started Day 6 with his queues mostly quiet. The newest base
(Production) queue is the lone exception as it is still building basic
construction and economy. Today, he must try to earn 19200. Tomorrow,
Monday, is his last day of protection. So, his goal today is to ensure
there is a Shipyard on each base. Fortunately, all bases have at least
one&mdash;except the newest one. 

With construction efforts focused on Base 8, the other bases have turned
to producing Goods. This is sometimes a maligned production item.
However, by building single quantities and filling his queue, Ben is
able to improve his economy by 11 credits an hour. This effort should
help reduce the cost of Base 8. 

Base Nine
---------

Base Nine was built early on Day 6 and was a production base. Its
primary focus was to build core production capability, one Shipyard and
five Spaceports. With these complete, Ben was able to establish two new
trade routes, which pushed his economy over 600.

Base Ten
--------

Base Ten was an error and a do-over. He built his tenth base on a Slot 3
Radioactive Moon, instead of the Slot 2 Rocky Planet. So, he razed the
base. This allowed him to buy his Tenth base for 3200&mdash;not a total
loss, but very embarrasing. He had to build another OS (2 hours) ship
the OS to the location (5.5 hours) and then get to building. He
established the final tenth base with ten hours remaining on the free
upgrade.

Defenses
--------

By the end of Day 6, the first nine bases had Plasma Turrets (2x for
some) with 100 Fighters. The loss of time for the last base caused a
delay.

Day Seven
=========

I stopped playing when the account upgrade expired. My major research
goal was all technology necessary for Cruiser, and I attained that:
