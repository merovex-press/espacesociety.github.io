This guide builds off of the [Advanced Structure Guide](/astro-empires/advanced-structure-guide), which
provides basic information on building an efficient empire. This guide
offers the reader a list of structures necessary to attain full
efficiency of your specialized astros. Naturally, this will interest
free players more. However, all players should find this informative.



This guide will approach the problem of efficient base structures from a
pessimistic perspective. That is, the least preferred astro type will be
used. 
Because this guide focuses on free play, Planets will be preferred.
Advanced structures will also be capped at five.
Slot 2 orbit will be assumed to help illustrate the advice given in the
[Advanced Base Guide](/astro-empires/advanced-base-guide). 
The first section discusses how to efficiently build a
Commerce Asteroid. The second section discusses how to build a Research
base. The final section discusses how to build a Production base.

General Information
===================

One question you may be asking yourself is why the different types of
bases need a certain configuration&mdash;and why that configuration is
different. There are two general categories of structures&mdash;Production
and Infrastructure&mdash;common to all bases. Production structures include
Metal Refineries, Robotic Factories, Nanite Factories and Androids
Factories. Infrastructure includes Urban Structures, various power
Plants, Command Centers and Spaceports. Technically, Terraforming is not
a structure.

If you look at the cost list of each type of Production structure,
you'll note that Metal Refineries-17 costs about the same as Nanite
Factories-9 (actually, the cost is within 100 credits).

Value of Structures
===================

Orbital Structures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Orbital Structures give free players a maximum of fifty population, and
this is not influenced by Biosphere Modification. The table below shows
the number of slots freed by removing Urban Strcutures based on
Fertility.

Antimatter Plants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Antimatter Plants generates a maximum of 100 energy, allowing free
players to disband 12 Fusion Plants while still providing four extra
energy units. The actual slot savings is five.


Commerce Asteroid
=================

The Commerce Asteroid is considered the pessimistic choice. This is
because you are limited in the number of structures you can build. You
are also limited in the amount of Crystals you can harvest. We will
assume Energy-20, which doubles output of your energy Plants.

When considering the value of an Asteroid, you should look at the
advanced strucutures.  Antimatter Plants combined with Orbital
Structures frees 15 slots on a Slot-2 Asteroid. Normally, a fully
terraformed Asteroid spends 23 slots for Urban Structures and Plants.
So, these advanced structures reclaim eight slots. For an Asteroid,
those slots would preferably be spent building ten more Shipyards (and
disband two Metal Refineries for the space). This gives 20 more economy.
