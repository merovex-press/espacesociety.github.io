Steps for using system:

1. Install: [the collaboration thing](http://espacesociety.org/astrography/javascripts/astrography.user.js). This is a Grease Monkey script, so you'll want Firefox and to install that as well.
2. Ensure you are using the "Original" skin. [ Change it here](http://helion.astroempires.com/account.aspx?view=display) to "AE Original."
2. Scan your Home Planet in Helion.
3. [Sign up](http://espacesociety.org/astrography/sign_up), check your email and confirm.
4. Contact in-game to be given access.

**Do not sign up for the following until you have your H server account.** You'll need to give that ID (e.g. yours on Gamma is G.2977).
