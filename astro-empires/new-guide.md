Introdution
===========

Welcome to GUILDNAME. This guild recognizes that Astro Empires is a
strategic war simulator. Economy is king because it fuels the war
machines. As such, this guild takes a more militant approach to its
activities. **Our purpose is to attain the first rank for a guild in all categories.**

We recognize that you may be a veteran player. If not, we still welcome
you. Please read our [NEWBIE GUIDE] to build your empire. This Policy
Guide explains the guild's rank structure and responsibilities,
diplomatic philosophy, and member goals. 



Hierarchy
==============

The GUILDNAME guild has a different rank structure than most. Typically,
guilds base rank off of economy, fleet size, etc. Astro Empire (AE) bases
rank off of a formula of economy, fleet and technology. Logically, a set
of ranks should derive from the AE levels as it is a superset of most
ranks structures. This causes one to wonder why exotic ranks are
created.

Because this is a military game, we adopt a hierarchy
of leadership. Players who are actively involved and able to lead others
are able to have a greater impact on the guild as a whole. 

Rank Structure
--------------

Our ranks derive from the player's responsibility (discussed below). A
player choses to become responsible for peers and becomes a Team Leader.
A Team Leader is developed to be a Section Leader when each of his team
members are themselves Team Leaders. Essentially, they direct their
teams, and he directs them. A Fleet Leader is a Section Leader whose
team has become Section Leaders. The table below describes this
structure, and shows the insignia indicating a leader. Finally, there
are other indicators when a player is on probation or in jeopardy of
losing guild status.

Responsibilities
----------------

Commander
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Commander is an honorary title bestowed regardless of rank. The
Commander manages the overall guild activities and chairs the Fleet
Counsel.

Fleet Leader
~~~~~~~~~~~

A Fleet Leader coordinates activities with his team of Section Leaders.
Fleet Leaders agree to engage in aggressive wars in Fleet Counsel. Fleet
Leaders may negotiate treaties with rival guilds.

Section Leader
~~~~~~~~~~~

Section Leaders manages activities with his team of Team Leaders. They
are authorized to engage in minor wars. They are also guild recruiters.
They are responsible for ensuring their Team Leaders are adequately
involved in their teams, and for helping their Team Leaders to become
Section Leaders. Section Leaders are responsible for enforcing
discipline (kicking idle or disciplinary players). Section Leaders may
spectate the Fleet Counsel. Because of the size of a Section is 20
members, a Section Leader will likely command teams within his Galaxy.
During mobilization, he will work with his Team Leaders to identify and
prioritize targets within his sphere of influence. During war, he will
coordinate activities and shift focus as necessary.

Team Leader
~~~~~~~~~~~

A Team Leader directs his team members. He is responsible for ensuring
that his members have adequate defenses, and helps coordinate support
for when one of his team members is attacked. During war, teams work
together in attack and defense. When each team member has fully
developed defenses and an adequate attack fleet, the members may then
begin taking on junior members and become Team Leaders. Team Leaders are
responsible for identifying members of their team who are idle or
disciplinary problems. During mobilization, the Team Leader designates
targets and works with his Section Leader to coordinate activities. At
war, the Team Leader will direct team activities and ensure all members
profit from the engagement.

Team Member
~~~~~~~~~~~

A Team Member is responsible for ensuring his bases are adequately
defended and that he builds an adequate attack fleet. Adequacy is based
on his tenure on Delta. He must continually work to improve his economy.
The must report any combat they engage in (attack or defense). At peace,
he will help monitor rival bases in his region. At mobilization, he will
report on target base locations and fleet sizes.  At war, he will attack
rival bases as directed and support team members under attack.

Diplomacy
=========

This guild's diplomacy must always serve its constituency and stated
goal. Members will support guild diplomacy.

Scout Taps
----------

GUILDNAME encourages scout taps on all rivals and friendlies. Just be
prepared to defend yourself. Scout taps against member bases subjects
that member to being put on report. We encourage defense build-up by
allowing guild members to tap one-another. As a new member is assigned a
Team Leader who is responsible for him, taps should never occur.

Member Goals
============

As a member of our guild, you are expected to help us fulfill the
guild's goals. This section discusses goals a member must make to remain
in the guild. Overall, the member is obligated to keep his Team Leader
fully informed of his base locations and any situation that may impact
these goals.

Activity
--------

Members are encouraged to visit Delta at least daily. Please also glance
over the forum and check the [CHANGES] page for any changes to policy.
Inactivity for more than 3 days without prior notice to your next-level
superior risks expulsion.

</table>

There are several levels of defensive fleet quality. The table above
helps visualize the quality of fleets. Each month, a player should
attain the next level of fleet quality. Thus, a player should reach the
Good-quality fleet month by the end of his second month. It may be
helpful for the member to use the emboldened letter in his fleet
identifier to show its quality at a glance, although Sections are
encouraged to adopt their own method as one method may reveal fleet
quality to rival guilds. Regardless, a scout taps against your bases are
not acceptable and you will be put on report.

Ideal
~~~~~~

Each base must have at least 500 times more fleet (i.e. 500 fleet
multiple) on his base than that base generates in economy. Thus, a base
generating 100 economy needs a 500,000 defense fleet. With this fleet,
the base must have 10 Command Centers, four Disrupter Turrets, and a
Planetary Shield. As a cherry on the top, a Leviathan with 5 Battleships
might be nice. This could generate a 4000/200/40/2 FT/CR/HC/BB fleet
(624K points). However, economies of 300+ make this ideal goal a
continuing challenge.

Initial
~~~~~~~

Obviously the ideal is difficult to attain. Players do not need to start
building fleet until Day 6. By that day, players should immediately
build 100 FT to cover their bases as well as one level of their best
turrets. The Initial goal must be met by Day 14.

Medial
~~~~~~

Once the initial defenses are established, the member should seek to
build a basic fleet (2000/100/20/1 FT/CR/HC/BB). This is a 312,000-point
fleet, which is a 300 fleet multiple on a 100-econ planet. A logical
step between initial and medial defenses is to build 1200 FT, then
build the 100 CR, then 800 FT (totalling 2000 FT), then 20 HC, then 1
BB. Once this fleet is built, the member should expand the fleet by that
ratio until the ideal fleet size is attained for that base.

Offensive Fleet Goals
---------------------

The offensive fleet goal is easier to describe. The ideal fleet goal is
a 500 fleet multiple for each base. That is, each base supports two
ideal defensive fleets&mdash;one is just offensive. Assuming you have ten
bases at 100 econ, that is a 5,000,000 point offensive fleet. Your total
fleet size is 10,000,000. By comparison, the highest fleet-ranked player
on Alpha has a 32.4 million point fleet.

Scouting
--------

Each member should keep track of rival bases within the Region of his
base. As one tenant of empire building is not to have more than one base
in a Region, this means that a player should be able to monitor at least nine
regions. There are 100 regions in a Galaxy. So, 11 players should be
able to keep tabs on an entire galaxy. That means that a Section should
easily be able to monitor and dominate a Galaxy. Naturally, team members
can negotiate monitoring activities.

When we mobilize, members will focus their attention on scouting guild
bases with whom we will war against. This includes calculating what is
necessary to occupy rival bases and optimizing an offensive fleet.
