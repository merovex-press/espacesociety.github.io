The following link is to a Battle Calculator that should work. I found it on the Internet, and fixed it. I also updated the shield strengths based on the recent unit updates.



To use it, you set your technology level. You then manually input the Power, Armour and Shield (PA&S) for the opponent's unit. As I've said before, have a Scout or Corvette ("scout") sneak to the enemy fleet and run through the attack sequence to get these AP&S values. Abort the attack and retreat the "scout."

For added covertness, sneak the "scout" to a distant astro in the region, then move to the target astro (if possible). When you see the fleet strength, copy and paste the data into a blank document (e.g. Notepad) and retreat. When your scout is outbound, you can then fat-finger the data into the calculator. 

One advantage of a Battle Calculator is that it allows you to test assumptions. For example, are Fighters more efficient than Bombers&mdash;or Frigates? (Answer, 1 FR costs 80, which is 16 FTs. In a same-tech battle, there will be 10 FTs remaining. Thus, FRs are inefficient.)

Kahar's Battle Calculator
===============

[KaHaR's Battle Calculator](http://www.mediafire.com/?i2yzyttzkjf) is described by some as the preferred calculator. I've not used it, but one person said:

> I use `KaHaRs because of it's accuracy. For instance in the last battle I used it, it predicted I would end up with 8034.4 HCs out of 9000 and in the actual battle I had 8035.4 remaining at the end. That's 99.9%25 accuracy.



AE Project's Battle Calculator
==================

Then there's always [AE Project's Battle Calculator](http://www.aeproject.org/calculators/battle), which is online. It has some advantages. Over the years, there have been accusations that the site is malicious, but I've never noticed.
