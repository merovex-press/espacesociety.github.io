This Revised Seven-Ten Guide provides a plan for building your empire in
the first week. This Guide assumes you will also be consulting the
[Advanced Base Guide](/astro-empires/advanced-base-guide) which explains which astros are preferable.

<div class=''>
Look to [the Ten Seven Guide](/astro-empires/the-ten-seven-guide) for advice not carried over from there.

Astro Picking
=============

<div class=''>
**Preferred Astro Types**: Rocky'_1, 2_'; Arid'_1, 2_'; Tundra'_1, 2_'; Gaia'_1, 2_'; Toxic'_4, 5_'; Earthly'_1_'.
</div>

When you start, Astro Empires will plant you where it wants. Optimally,
you will want to build on the preferred astro types on the slot
recommended.
If you do not get one of those astros, my recommendation is to restart
that account.

The table below offers a suggested order for selecting and building
bases during your first week. Feel free to vary the order based on your
local astropography. The astro type order is based on
preference&mdash;preferred to acceptable starting from the left. Where it
says "Any," I mean any of the preferred astros, mentioned above.

In the [Advanced Base Guide](/astro-empires/advanced-base-guide), there is a greater discussion on which
astros to select. The key to early success in Astro Empires is specializing
bases and optimizing those specializations. When planning your overall
base specialization, remember that your first base will be a joint
Production-Research base. This base is Research specialized because you
have built several Research Labs to conduct critical research. This base
is Production specialized because the astro is likely not one of the
optimal astros for Research. By putting a dual focus on this first base,
you ensure none of your efforts are wasted. Remember the adage "haste
makes waste" when planning your bases.

Building your bases too close together is a very bad idea. It allows
larger rivals to pick them off in rapid succession. Therefore, try not
to have more than one base in a region. Defensively speaking, your bases
need to be self-sufficient.  But, that begins in Day Six. The closest
your bases should be is in adjacent regions, but even that risks your
bases being attacked in short order by a dedicated opponent.

Defenses
========

<div class=''>
Simply put, build Fighters over your base as you can. Research Laser and
Missle tech to put Laser or Missile Turret-2/-3 on your bases before the
Corvettes start tapping.
</div>

Under the original first week rules for Astro Empires, players were
untouchable for the first week. The exception was at the beginning of a
new server. This guide is a revision because those rules allow a player
to be hit at Level-X by approximately ranked players. Therefore, players
must turn to defenses sooner. I provide a detailed discussion on defense
in my [Base Defense Guide](/astro-empires/base-defense-guide). Under these rules, as soon as Corvettes
become viable (Day 2) then you are a target.

The core principles are this: build turrets to protect your base's
economy, and build Fleet to protect your base's trade routes. Early on,
protection can be defined as creating more damage to your opponent than
he might gain in the attack.

When you are able, build a couple of Fighters to start your trade route
defense. This requires a Shipyard and Laser research, below.

Base defenses are a little more precarious. You will likely exceed an
economy of 20 in the first day, with an economy of 30 by the second day.
Laser Turret-2/-3 protects bases with economy below 20. So, you may want
to skip over and pick up Missle technology to build Missle
Turrets-2/-3. A Missle Turret will take out 4 Corvettes. Coupled with a
light Fighter screen, the base should be well protected on the first few
days. Regardless, the defensive choice is to have at least two of either
two turret type quickly.

Thereafter, you will be building your Fighter screen. As the first week
moves on, you will climb toward Plasma tech to build Destroyers and
Cruisers. As you obtain the ability to build Plasma Turrets, build them.
Do not retire the weaker turrets until you see shielded unites (e.g.
Cruisers) or are strapped for space.
