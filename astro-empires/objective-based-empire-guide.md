The Objective-Based Guide to Empire Building offers a player goals to
help his empire thrive. The guide is topically arranged chronologically.
That is, from the beginning to the end are recommended goals. If you
prefer a different goal, feel free to omit them. The table of contents
provides an at-a-glance listing.



Quick Economy
=============

When first starting your empire, you will need a few Metal Refineries.
These are the core of your ability to build quickly. After you have
built a few (two or three), build a Spaceport. Look for local trade
opportunities to give yourself an easy three credit boost.

Corvette Scouts
===============

Corvettes are the ideal scout. They are quick enough, and they are
combat units. When scouting, you may find neighbors worth tapping for a
few extra credits. I prefer one base per region, so reconnaisance is
critical.
