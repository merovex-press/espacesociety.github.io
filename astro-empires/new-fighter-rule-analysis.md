Introduction
============

`AstroEmpires recently 
[ changed the Fighter Rules](http://forum.astroempires.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=70020) 
against units it would normally be shield-raped by&mdash;in the interests of
fairness. As this article points out, the real affect is to empower
established players over newer players, and to try to imbalance the
tenants of the [Small Fleet Doctrine](/astro-empires/small-fleet-doctrine), which in reality remain
effective. Odd that "fairness" advantages the elite. My analysis shows
that the actual impact is misstated because of weak examples.

This rule only applies to Fighters against shield-raping units. This
benefits advanced players who have [capital units](/astro-empires/small-fleet-doctrine).
This is a misguided effort to make capital ships matter.



Rant
=========

My complaint is secondarily against the shoddy explanation on their
part. They use worst-case examples rather than real-life. They imply
abilities that were meant to be game-balancing. They zeroize technology,
again ignoring real-life differentials. Finally, one example mixes the
fact, hiding the real ratio impact.

With planetary rings, they show the "worst case" example of a
planet, not the "average case" of moons. The actual average actual
average of the three types is 29,167 
when looking at the raw costs. However, there are fewer planets
than moons as a truism. Seasoned players favor moons and asteroids over
planets because of this lower cost. Bases will tend to be on moons and
asteroids. Therefore, their hypothetical *overstates* actual gameplay 
by at-least double.

Assuming moons are the average, AE would only allow 25,000 FTs to attack
prings. This reduces the damage per wave to 1100 points,
from 10,752. This
severely reduces the efficiency of Fighters, significantly increasing the cost of
conquest with Fighters. However, the real impact is against pshields,
where the impact is much more severe. The table below shows the
cost-ratio, which helps show the impact.

The abstract example further conceals the practical. If a capital can
carry, say 1000 FTs in the case of a Titan, then that affects the combat
ratio. In real life, an naval aircraft carrier or battleship has escorts
and fighter coverage. So, too, in `AstroEmpires are there escort units
and Fighters.

They describe the "Fighter shield-crossing ability," which is not an
ability at all. It was an effort to give Fighters a chance, an effort
with the unforeseen advantage in massive amounts. Other units have a
similar ability. One could construe this phrase to suggest a special
ability.

They baselined the examples with zeroized technology. Any player who has
played for 2 months should have Armour of at least 22. Capital units
require higher armour tech, tilting the real values in favor of the
capitals by as much as 15 percent in the case of a Death Star. It also
ignores the impact of derb harvesting afterward.

The example of the Fighters attacking the Battleship shows, at least,
sloppy reasoning. In the original example, only Fighters are attacking.
In the second example, Bombers are added, trebbling the attacker's
ratio. The real loss to the defender would have been only 6,875 credits.
The attacker's losses is uniform in either case at 4,200.  So, the
*real* ratio is 1.63:1; the example had 3.17:1. This error is double
the example. The example shows a one-third reduction in the ratio. The real
reduction is two-thirds.

So, we see in the examples the misstated impact by at-least double is
uniform. This seems to suggest an awareness of the true impact, and an
effort to minimize reaction to that impact.

Shields are useless against massive attacking units, that is what AE 
admitted. Just throw a few mio FTs and all opponents are toast. This is
a ploy I have seen used since I started playing in Summer 2007. This is nothing
new, just something they decided to change. But, AE is basically
saying the cost ratio of a unit's armour is the fundamental determinant.
That allows us to put some real analysis into the impact on the game.

Analysis
========

To distill their analysis, divide your unit's armour by its cost (or cost,
by armour). Let's look at a the cost-ratio of units.

Using the table above, if you want to kill a shielded unit, just make
sure you use a lot of shield-raped unshielded that have a lower
cost-ratio. As this applies only to shield-rapers, it weakens the
Cruiser only slightly. They weakend Fighters to the same level as
Heavy-Bombers, but still greater than all capital units.

Corvettes and Destoyers Ascendant
=================================

Looking at the table above, you see that Corvettes, Destroyers and
Bombers are the new most-efficient units *against capitals and planetary defenses*. 
As Bombers are poor defensive units and require transportation, I omit
them from this ascendancy.  However, as these units are vulnerable to
FTs, you must first denude capitals of their FT escort.

<div class=''>

Looking at the FT v TI example they gave, the ratio *was* 5.88 : 1
(reduced to 1.70 : 1). This suggests that the FT's cost-ratio is reduced
to 0.29 against Battleships and Capital units. Against a Dreadnought,
this is still a 2.63:1 ratio.

</div>

Against prings, Corvettes and Destroyers are now the master. To remove
Pring-1, one must deliver 11,260 Power. Against pringles, one must
deliver 33,780 Power. The example below compares old Fighters, new
Fighters, Corvettes, Destroyers and Cruisers.
