<a name='teaser'></a>If you are a regular, then you may notice a slightly lighter site design than previously used. The previous design served E-Space Society for the past few years. I forget if it was four or five years.

I've also been thinking about how to make the site more useful; so stay tuned for updates.

On other news, for the past three years, I've been creating a series of [Astro Empires guides](/events/astro-empires) that provide a view into how the game functions. Through they years, I've received scores of comments; usually thanking me for helping light the way.
