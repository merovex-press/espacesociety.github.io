It is the beginning of yet another year on Everyspace Society. Looking at the
content generated over the past six years, and looking at the traffic we
receive now, I chose to post this inaugural article for Astro Empires visitors.

First, welcome! Espace receives hundreds of visitors each week. You come here
generally to read the [AstroEmpires/Small Fleet Doctrine](/astro-empires/small-fleet-doctrine) article, but there
are others you view as well. I appreciate the interest, the data was earned
through playing, winning and losing.

But, the articles need to remain fresh and relevant to you. You have questions
and needs that exceed the articles written. So, I'm asking for you, via your
comments below, for insight to what you seek.

Now is January. Toward the end of May and early June, the next server will
start. One thing I thought of was a series of discussions preparing players for
server start. What do you think?
