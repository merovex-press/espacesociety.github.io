This page should discuss milestones and other events, not necessarily just E-Space related.

To add an event, three things should happen:

# In CurrentEvents.CurrentEvents, you need to "include" the story. We include so it is easier to move events around without a lot of cutting and pasting. To include you just put in this [==] tag on the page, where YYYY is the year, Mon is the three letter month abbreviation, and DD is the day.

# In [CurrentEvents.Past](/current-events/past-), you need to put a link to the story, in logical order with the other links. The link syntax is [=[ your title](/current-events/y-yy-ymon-d-d-)=].

# You need to edit the story. Once you've created the link on the past events page, then you'll be able to click-through and be put into an editing context.

That's it!
