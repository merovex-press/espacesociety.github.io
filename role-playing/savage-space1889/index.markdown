Character Creation
==================

Conversions
-----------

New characters should use the standard creation procedures found in Savage Worlds. The chart below provides the conversions between Space 1889 and Savage Worlds for Abilities, Stats and Ranks. Which way you convert ranks (e.g. from Space 1889 to Savage Words, or vice versa) depends on whether you want it to retain the Space 1889 feel.

**Character Generation:** Humans get 5 points for attribute raises, up to 4 points in hindrances, 15 skill points and 1 free edge.  Human common knowledge applies to Earth only.  Human careers are in the Space 1889 book.  You must purchase the skills to the level indicated in order to have the career.  All careers gain common knowledge about the career based off the characters smarts.  Additional Wealth and career benefits are found in the conversion section. 

Hindrances/Edges
----------------

While more hindrances than 4 points worth can be chosen, no further points should be received from those hindrances.  Unless the GM says otherwise, the only Arcane Background allowed is Weird Science.


<dl><dt>Arcane Backgrounds (Edge)</dt><dd> Only Weird Science truly fits for character use.  NPCs may have Miracles, Weird Science, Psionics and even Magic but player characters should not.  These NPCs should be very rare.</dd>
</dl>

:Traditionalist (Hinderance):Traditionalists have trouble trying things outside the scope of their career or the ancient dictates of their people.  Using skills and knowledge outside the traditional scope incurs a 1 penalty to that skill or action.  Activities within the career of the character have a +1 bonus.  Activities that are outside the career but are traditionally done by the characters people are normal.


<dl><dt>Outsider (Hinderance)</dt><dd> This hindrance also reflects the European air of superiority toward other nationalities and natives.  Fellow countrymen are immune from the penalty but the rest of the world, and other worlds, are not!</dd>
</dl>

Wealth
-------


<table class='table'><tr>
  <td>3d6 x 100 or 1,000 pounds sterling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Wealthy Gentry (very rich)</td>
  <td>2d6 x 100 or 700 pounds sterling.</td>

<tr>
  <td>Gentry (rich)</td>
  <td>1d6 x 100 or 350 pounds sterling.</td>

<tr>
  <td>Middle Class</td>
  <td>2d6 x 25 or 175 pounds sterling.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Working Class (poverty)</td>
  <td>2d6 x 5 or 35 pounds sterling.</td>
</tr>
</table>

Increase the wealth as per book ([`Space1889] p. 12) for Merchant, Adventuress, Criminal or Master Criminals.  Income and bonuses (including a NPC which can become a sidekick) are as on [`Space1889] p.  13 of the book. Use prices per book.

Careers
-------

In order to get credit for a career you must have purchased all the skills, at the level indicated, with your skill points as well as have the prerequisites. Cascade skills can cover all backgrounds. Leadership is satisfied through edges.  At GM discretion, other bonuses can be added.  

Martians
--------


<dl><dt>Hill Martians</dt><dd> Hill Martians get 5 points for attribute raises but Strength may not rise above a d10 and Vigor starts at a d6.  All Hill Martians have the minor hindrance "All Thumbs".  Hill Martians can have up to 3 points of hindrances, 15 skill points and get 1 free edge.  Hill Martian careers are Nomad Warriors (Career skills of Riding (Gashaunt and Ruumet Breehr), Shooting (bow), and Survival) and Free-Lancer (Career skills of Riding (Gashaunt), Shooting (bow or musket), Stealth and Survival).  Martians can use common knowledge of Mars but do not know about other planets without spending skill points.  Traditional Hill Martian skills are Fighting, Throwing, Guts, Notice, Climbing, Stealth (if not a career skill), Gambling, Healing, Intimidation, Taunt and Tracking.   </dd>
</dl>

:Canal Martians: Canal martians receive 5 points for attribute raises but Strength may not rise above a d10 and Vigor starts at a d6.  All Canal Martians have the minor (new) hindrance "Traditionalist".  Canal Martians can have up to 3 points of hindrances, 15 skill points and get 1 free edge.  Canal Martian careers are Mercenary Soldier (Career skills of Shooting (bow or musket), Fighting, Survival and Stealth), Cloud Sailor (Career skills of Shooting (musket), Gunnery (muzzle-loading cannons), Fighting and Trimsman (cloudship)), and Merchant (Career skills Riding (Rurmet Breehr), Fighting, Shooting (powder pistol or bow), Survival and Persuasion).  Martians can use common knowledge of Mars but do not know about other planets without spending skill points.  Traditional Canal Martian skills are Throwing, Guts, Notice, Climbing, Gambling, Healing, Swimming, Intimidation, Crime, Streetwise, Taunt, and Knowledge (cloudships, tactics, Martian History, Navigation, Medicine and Martian customs). 

Skills
----------

<dl><dt>Trimsman (New Skill)</dt><dd> Covers the working of the liftwood panels in flying ships.  This is a critical skill for keeping a ship from plunging out of the sky (see the cloudship conversion for more details).  Gunnery</dd>
</dl>

:Skills that did not change (other than name): Throwing, Notice (Observation in 1889), Swimming, Healing (Medicine in 1889), and Tracking. 


<dl><dt>Skill "lost" from 1889</dt><dd> Leadership is covered through leadership edges.  Give one edge per two skill levels (starting with Command) as appropriate.  </dd>
</dl>

:"New" Skills to 1889: Guts, Climbing, Gambling, Intimidation, Investigation, Streetwise, Taunt, Weird Science and Knowledge (Area, Tactics, History, Law, Medicine or Customs/Religion) all of which are found as basic SW skills.

**Cascade Skills.** Cascade skills have a base skill with several skills as a subgroup.  A character can choose a skill in one of the subcategories of the cascade and that skill will be one level higher than the overall skill while the other listings will have a skill level one dice step less, to a minimum of 1d4-2, in the cascade.  For example: a Hill Martian Nomad has a Shooting Skill of d6.  He chooses to specialize in bow.  When shooting a bow he would use a d8, when shooting any other weapon in the cascade, like a musket, he would use a d4.  Without specialization he would be a d6 with all.  

Cascade Skills (new ones marked with*) are:

<dl><dt>Shooting (Marksman in 1889)</dt><dd> Bow, Pistol (black powder), Pistol (other), Musket, or Rifle.</dd>
<dt>Fighting (Fisticuffs and Close Combat in 1889)</dt><dd> Fisticuffs, Edged Weapons, Pole Weapons or Bashing Weapons.</dd>

</dl>

Inventions
==========

Space 1889 has several inventions listed on [`Space1889] p. s 62 to 71 with the research requirements on [`Space1889] p. s 78 to 81.  While the bulk, weight and cost remain the same, SW uses different mechanics to get there.  The Cascade skills for researching any inventions are Knowledge Science, Engineering and Repair with the associated sub-skills. Roll one dice for each indicated skill area needed for the device, total all the dice and check if the invention design score is reached.  If any dice scored a failure ignore that dice.  If a critical failure (a 1) was scored on either dice, ignore the all rolls that "round" (a wild dice can substitute as normal).  Only one "round" per week is allowed unless the players are rushed by circumstances and the GM allows faster rolls.  At that point up to one roll every two days is possible.  Other players may aid by rolling an appropriate skill dice with every success (and raise) adding +2 to the inventors score.  Once the "science" has established a design, an attempt can be made to build a prototype.  

To invent a prototype you must have the tools and have spent the amount indicated for all the materials.  Roll your Weird Science skill dice and subtract the "reliability" modifier found on [`Space1889] p.  81.  A success means your design is reliable and the first one is built.  Each raise increases the reliability of the machine by 1 dice type (success = d4, 1 raise = d6, etc.).  This is the dice rolled to make that item work for another user or if stressed.  A failure means half the materials are lost due to faulty design and you must start over.  A critical failure allows the GM to decide on a suitable disaster and the ruination of all the materials.  These devices do not fall apart but must be maintained by their inventor or they lose one reliability dice level after each major, as determined by the GM, use. 

In addition, a weird scientist can make items using his power points as outlined in Savage worlds.  Such items can be used by anyone else at a 4 using the Weird Science skill of the weird scientist as the reliability dice.  Each device takes a week to construct and uses spare parts lying around in the lab.  Devices can be dismantled to free up the power points.  Lost or stolen devices become useless after a week, or less, and fall apart freeing the points for the original maker.  

Cloudship/Airship Combat
========================

I recommend you use the rules for cloudship combat given in 1889 with the Savage World adjustments for weapon effects given.  If a more abstract version is desired the Savage World pursuit rules can be used with the following adjustments.  After cards  determine the initial range, the faster moving ship declares if it is closing range, maintaining range or opening range.  The slower ship can only use obstacles (mountains, cloud cover) to adjust this distance.  The captain makes the piloting rolls to steer the ship but a trimsman is needed to adjust the height of the ship.  No roll is needed to maintain the current height or adjust a height level by one unless the height adjustment is caused by damage to the ship or to avoid an obstacle.  As a guide, modifiers for trimsman and piloting rolls are: Easy: automatic unless untrained, then roll at a +2 (ie 1d4-2+2), Moderate: roll a success, Difficult: -2 from the roll, Formidable: -4 and Impossible: -6 or more.

Exotic Weapons statistics are as follows: Divide the effective range by 10 to get short range.  Double the short range to get medium range, and double the medium range to get long range.  The damage value converts to d6 damage on a one to one basis plus 2d6.  The reliability number is 1/2 the maximum score on reliability dice.  

<div class=''>
Lightning Cannon: Range 20x(1/2 the maximum score on reliability dice) for short range. 
Damage = (#of d6 = 1/2 the maximum score on reliability dice) +2d6 with an AP value = (1/2 the maximum score on reliability dice).
Heat Ray: Range 100x(1/2 the maximum score on reliability dice) for short range in &#8232; 	atmosphere.  Damage = 10d6 in atmosphere, 12d6 in space/ether, -1d6 for each  &#8232; 	adjustment in book.
