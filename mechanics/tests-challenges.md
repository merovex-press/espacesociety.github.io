I just borrowed this from a Fate site to have something to show.

*[This stuff is more GM-oriented than player-oriented.]*

There are four types of die-rolling conflicts in FATE:

# StaticTest: A single roll by a player against a set difficulty.
# StaticChallenge: This is a more complex series of tests, where a combination of successes is needed to achive a certain accomplishment.
# DynamicTest: Like a StaticTest, but with multiple people competing.
# DynamicChallenge: Use for multi-roll contests between multiple people.

Yeah, that's a lot of terminology to sling about.

There are actually *three* related ways of dealing with person-vs-person items in a simple, one-roll fashion.  (I think it's unduly confusing; each has its own interesting aspect, but having all three floating around just complicates matters):.

* In a **STATIC CONTEST**, the GM has set the difficulty (in the sample dart game, Average), each player rolls against their skill, and the player with the higher MarginOfSuccess wins. This is sort of a two-person StaticTest, with both people vying against the difficulty, not each other (i.e., what each person does doesn't affect the other). (FUG 10)

* In a **DYNAMIC CHECK**, there is no base difficulty given; it's just the two players rolling against their skill (to run to the door first, in this case), and comparing their result (their skill level as modified by their roll), with the better overall result being the winner. (FUG 12)

* And this is not to be confused with the **DynamicTest**, as mentioned above; this is like a Dynamic Check, only the MarginOfSuccess between the results gets compared to the table.

*... Hence, the GM would use those rolls in the following situations:*

* *StaticTest' - When the character is performing an action at a set difficulty that's simple enough to be handled in one roll (jumping across a chasm)*

* *StaticChallenge - When the character is performing an action at a set difficulty that's too complex to be resolved in one roll (disarming an explosive)*

* *DynamicTest - When the character is actively opposed by some person/force, or the conditions of the action are fluid enough to warrant an opposed roll, but the action is simple enough to resolve in one roll (two people trying to get their hands on something at the same time, someone dodging a magical trap that's been sprung)*

* *DynamicChallenge - When the character is actively opposed by some person/force, or the conditions of the action are fluid enough to warrant an opposed roll, but the action is complex enough to require more than one roll (combat, two people trying to hack each other's computer at the same time, two people playing chess, disarming a self-aware explosive)*

*The reason why the sidebar also mentions a **static contest** as an optional rule is because sometimes, people can be competing with each other and yet not be actively affecting one another. The example given of a game of darts is apt, because while you're trying to beat your partner, you're not actively doing anything to hinder his progress. Two people running the 50-yard dash would be another example. So, as an option, you could have them roll **static tests** against the same difficulty and compare MoS for the winner, or in a **challenge**, simply declare the winner the one who gets to the end of the challenge grid first.*
