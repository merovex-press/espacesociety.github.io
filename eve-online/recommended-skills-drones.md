Drone Skills
====================

<a name='dro'></a>
If you fly any ship bigger than a frigate you will want [drone skills -> http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Drones](drone skills -> http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Drones). To be most effective, you will need to get Tech II drones, which means investing even more time and effort in drone skill development. T2 light drones are a great help in Level 4 missions, where they make short work of frigates which scramble your valuable battleship, stopping you from warping out if the mission goes wrong.

If you plan to fly the skill-intensive Typhoon you will want T1 heavy drones, and good drone support skills&mdash;and T2 heavy drones in the long term.

Uses **Perception** and **Memory**.

To get Tech 2 drones, youÂ’ll need some of the four racial 'Drone Specialization' skills. Minmatar and Gallente are the most important (Small, Medium, Heavy):
* Minmatar drones (Warrior, Valkyrie and Berserker) are very fast, and so are popular in PvP; they also do well against the Angels which you fight in many missions from Minmatar agents
* Gallente drones (Hobgoblin, Hammerhead and Ogre) do tons of damage, and so are also popular in PvP; they also do well against most types of NPC rat
* ECM drones can be a useful tool if you're flying solo or in a small gang with no dedicated ECM ship.

Try to use small (S) drones against frigates, medium (M) against cruisers and heavy (H) or sentry (L) drones against battleships.
