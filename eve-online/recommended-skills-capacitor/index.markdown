Capacitor Skills
================

<a name='cap'></a>
**Caldari and Minmatar.** These pilots don't depend on capacitor power as much as other races do, but it's still very important, especially for active tanks, for running propulsion modules and for capacitor warfare. You'll want Energy Systems Operation at level V and Energy Management to level IV at least. Cap Boosters are useful in some PvP fits, so you'll want to be able to fit the best with Energy Grid Upgrades IV.

**Amarr and Gallente.** Capacitor is life  without energy in your capacitor, you cant run active modules, your defenses degrade, and you end up stripped of your ship, floating in space in a pod. Amarr pilots depend on capacitor energy to run active armor tanks and to fire lasers, and as a result, they must develop several capacitor management skills. You'll want Energy Systems Operation at level 5 and Energy Management to level 4 at least. Cap Rechargers or Cap Boosters are prevalent in most PvP fittings, so you'll want to be able to fit the best with good Energy Grid Upgrade skills, 4.

Uses **Intelligence** and **Memory**. 

These are all the skills you need to optimize the size, recharge rate and efficiency of your capacitor:
