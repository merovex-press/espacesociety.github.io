Armor Tanking Skills
====================

<a name='arm'></a>
If you want to fit armor buffer tanks or active armor tanks you'll want to train armor support skills and be able to fit T2 armor tanking modules. Armor tanking is popular for PvP.

To fit T2 modules, train Mechanic and Hull Upgrades to level V. This is the Armor Tanking Certification-Improved.

**Amarr.** Because most Amarr ships favor an armor tanking approach, Amarr pilots must become proficient at armor taking skills. Specifically, Amarr pilots should train as quickly as possible to fit Tech II armor tanking modules. A Tech II tank is more than 40%25 more effective than a Tech I tank  a huge competitive advantage.

**Gallente.** Because most Gallente ships favor an armor tanking approach, Gallente pilots must become proficient at armor taking skills. Specifically, Gallente pilots should train as quickly as possible to fit Tech II armor tanking modules. A Tech II tank is more than 40%25 more effective than a Tech I tank  a huge competitive advantage.

Uses **Intelligence** and **Memory**.
