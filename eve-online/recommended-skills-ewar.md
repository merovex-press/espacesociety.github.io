EWAR Skills
===========
<a name='ewa'></a>

Electronic Warfare is a major part of fleet and small gang combat operations, especially in the UNI. Because most of our opponents have higher skill levels than the typical Eve University pilot, we must neutralize their natural advantage  and EWAR is an effective way to do this. An experienced pilot, even with tens of millions of skill points and a host of powerful faction ship modules, can do nothing if they cant target anything. With the right combination of EWAR, you can practically turn off an opponent's ship. Combined tackling and Electronic Warfare can render even the sturdiest tank and most ominous firepower absolutely useless.

The Crucifier and Arbitrator are the two Tech 1 ewar ships in the Amarr lineup. Both rely on tracking disruption, which shuts down turret-based targets rather effectively, but are useless against missile-wielding enemies (i.e. most Caldari Pilots)
