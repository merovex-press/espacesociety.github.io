Tackling Skills
===============

<a name='tac'></a>
All PvP combat pilots need to train up on tackling skills. These are the skills you need to prevent a target from escaping. These are usually the first combat skills learned by new pilots, because they are easy to master, and because they are highly valued, especially in fleet.

If you ever plan to venture into 0.0 space, you might also consider training Anchoring to Level II or more. This skill is used to deploy various items in space, including mobile warp disruptors  youll need this to set up warp disruption bubbles in null-sec space. By the way, Anchoring is also useful for setting storage containers in space, which is helpful if you plan to make some ISK as a miner.
