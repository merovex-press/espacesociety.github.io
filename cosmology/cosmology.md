**Cosmology** is the study of the large-scale structure and history of E-Space. For our purposes, this section discusses the various scientific assumptions we chose to help validate our setting. Most of this deals with superluminal, faster-than-light, travel as our present understanding of physics would seem to deny us this feat.

We chose an understanding of the NaturalSciences/BraneTheory as a plausible way of explaining how superluminal travel was possible. From that, we discuss NaturalSciences/BraneHopping, which translates Brane Theory into action. Finally, NaturalSciences/MagneticMonopoles are the material that makes superluminal travel work.
