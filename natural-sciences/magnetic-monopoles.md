## What are they?

Simply put, Magnetic Monopoles would be a new type of subatomic particle. This particle would have either a North or South magetic charge, but not an electric charge. I imagine they would have mass of slightly less than a proton (if that matters to anyone.)

Finding one would be like finding a N end of a magnet without finding a S end. They would be attracted to magnetic fields of the opposite flavor and can be manipulated by using electromagnetic fields.

Additionally, a N and S monopole could pair up and form a bizarre atom which I have dubbed Magnetium. Magnetium could weakly bond with other substances whose molecular or atomic structure provides for something physicists would call a "magnetic moment." Which just means that part of the molecule has slightly magnetic. (This is not uncommon at all.) 

## What do they do? Why are they valuable?

There are a few really important uses for magnetic monopoles:

### Fusion Reactors

Monopoles allow you to build a really strong magnetic field that can easily be manipulated to fire up the plasma reaction for a fusion generator and contain the plasma. 

### Ramscoop Drives

Similarly, monopoles provide you with an easy way to funnel and accelerate particles in a ramscoop drive. This increases the efficiency of such drives greatly.

### FTL Travel: HyperSpace

Through a generally unspecified means. Monopoles are essential for the mechanism that allows brane-hopping.

## How do they fit in the timeline?

Monopoles were _officially_ discovered early in the [First Expanse](/chronology/first-expanse-), but it took until the middle of that period for them to really take off as a critical resource. Some conspiracy theorists suspect that they were discovered earlier, but were kept a corporate secret. 

The popularization of the brane-hopping drive lead to a "monopole rush" of smaller prospecting ships zipping out as far as they dared to other stars in search of bountiful asteroid belts.
