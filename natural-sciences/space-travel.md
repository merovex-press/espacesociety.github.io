Discussion of [Brane Theory](/natural-sciences/brane-theory) may be interesting, but it fails to
provide the information needed for day-to-day living. This article
explains the practical application of modern science to space travel.



Subluminal Travel
=================

Light travels at 300,000 kilometers per second. Science has proven this
sufficiently constant to be relied upon inside star systems. Stellar
units are typically rated in percentages of light speed, or **%25C**.
One-percent of light speed is 3,000 kilometers per second.

Intrasteller distances are typically measured by time distance in light:
light minutes, light hours, etc. One AU is approximately 150 million
kilometers, or 0.139 light hours. A unit travelling at 1%25C would take
13.9 hours to cover that distance; if it were at full speed. A unit
starting at a (relatively) dead start and coming to a full stop would
take roughly twice as long (due to acceleration, deceleration), or 2.78
hours.

By comparison, it would take a ship at 1%25C travelling from Earth to
Pluto 54 hours, or 2.25 days.

Superluminal Travel
===================

Theory for travel in the Soup is [already explained](/natural-sciences/brane-theory).  In
the Soup, stellar distances are between 10 and 5400 paces. Distances
are not dependent on Realspace distances, which has caused humanity to
redefine the meaning of galaxies. A ship's subluminal rate tends to
translate to Soup travel, where each "pace" is roughly 1%25C per hour.
So, a unit rated at 3 can cover 2100 paces in 700 hours (29 days). Thus,
a unit rated at 1 travelling the maximum distance would take 225 days to
reach its destination.
