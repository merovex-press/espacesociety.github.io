The Scholar [Macropedia/Kemen Febrer Suwor](/macropedia/kemen-febrer-suwor) developed the Gravatonic Interloquiter Equation (GIE, pronounced "guy") during the [Chronology/First Expanse](/chronology/first-expanse). The theory behind GIE essentially stated that risk of hop failure increased geometrically as one approched a gravity body. Just as it was coincidence that 37 degrees Celcius is the average temperature of the human body, it was discovered that being 1 AU from Sol was the point where the geometric increase far outstripped the advantage of jumping. Arbitrarily, that point was labelled GIE 10&ndash;point of abject failure. The scale was also marked at the point outside the solar wind, GIE 1. During the previous expanse, the average trans-system ship could safely jump up to GIE 9. This is based in part on stellar magnitude. Thus, if the stellar magnitude of a star is 2.4, GIE 10 will likely be found at 2.4 AU. Likewise, GIE 1 is found at 94 AU from Sol&ndash;the extent of the solar wind. So, with a stellar magnitude of 2.4, the distance will be 225.6 AU.

Here is a rough chart of the various GIE factors.
* GIE 10 = 1 AU
* GIE 9  = 4 AU
* GIE 8  = 9 AU
* GIE 7  = 16 AU
* GIE 6  = 25 AU
* GIE 5  = 36 AU
* GIE 4  = 49 AU
* GIE 3  = 64 AU
* GIE 2  = 81 AU
* GIE 1  = 94 AU

During the early period of the Terran Decline, there was a massive change in the safe level for hops. In the more travelled systems, GIE 3 was considered safe. The suddeness of the change followed by economic problems through Terran Space, caused most trade to cease. That is, GIE 3, while safe, was considered too cost prohibitive to travel.
