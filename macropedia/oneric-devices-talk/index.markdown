*This is an [[Oneric Devices](/macropedia/oneric-devices)](/macropedia/oneric-devices) talk.*

Cute :)

Only one question: you haven't mentioned bullets - can't they be made using the Oneric techniques? And if they can, why the first Oneric weapons weren't simply guns with such bullets?

I don't think so.  The Oneric devices were meant as a return of close melee combat, and projectile weapons are anything but.
