# *A talk about [[Nguyonhi Assault Suits](/macropedia/nguyonhi-assault-suits)](/macropedia/nguyonhi-assault-suits):*

Are the suits actually more like worms, or more like humans? Or somehow other way? Do you rather wear them, or get/sit in them?

The suits are roughly man-sized, basically a full-body armor.  The parts that are based on the worm (this is a highly engineered variant) make up the large bulk.  The musculature and the nervous system of the modified worm serves both to greatly amplify the strength and reactions of the individual wearing the suit.  The bio-AI net is smart enough to co-ordinate all these activities, and while not a full intelligence, is quite capable of integrating into the human nervous system without any heavy modification to the human.
