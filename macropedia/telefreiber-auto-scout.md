## Telefreiber Auto Scout

The Telefreiber Auto Scout is a nifty little helpmate in unfamiliar territory. Fitting in a typical fieldpack handily, the Auto Scout can be used to find local resources such as water, shelter, and can even be set to seek help and habitation.

The cannister releases up to 8, 4 cm robotic scouts. They will head out and using both visual and sonic scanners start mapping the local area. The cannister can be used as a display that the scouts report back to. It can also be (usually) linked to a portable [Ether](/macropedia/ether).

Telefreiber leveraged their "swarm-bot" technology to this application after it garnered a bit of resentment from their [Observers](/macropedia/telefreiber-observers).

Generally speaking, these kits are fairly decent survival gear. The little 'bots are quite vulnerable to any number of hostile means of destruction or interference, and you certainly don't want an enemy following one back you your hideout.

There have been occasional reports of Telefreiber's Warrior Ants becoming disoriented by interaction with Auto Scouts. However, I don't think I'd bet my life on it.
