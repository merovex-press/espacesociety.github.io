Major armaments corporation founded during the High Imperium by the [Dinzwar Gefera](/macropedia/dinzwar-gefera) security firm.  The Dinzwar Gefera were apparently concerned about relying upon other armaments companies, many of which were heavily infiltrated by [BID](/macropedia/bafiktuy-intelligence-directive) agents.  Initially the company did little more than produce knockoffs of other designs, which got it into a good deal of trouble with Imperium patent officials.

A series of talented and forward-looking directors saw that the corporation, and the [Dinzwar Gefera](/macropedia/dinzwar-gefera), would be much better served by increasing the research and development departments.  The purchase of a small [anthorph](/macropedia/anthorph) [[Fteigar Alloy](/macropedia/fteigar-alloy)](/macropedia/fteigar-alloys) manufacturing company, Escadoma Corp, was a major part of a long-range plan to produce new classes of weapons.

The corporation became such a revenue generator that it could actually afford to buy a star system, [([Star Systems](/macropedia/star-systems).)Raj Mulakane](/star-systemsraj-mulakane), which became the official headquarters for the corporation, and the unofficial headquarters of the [Dinzwar Gefera](/macropedia/dinzwar-gefera).  In this way, the [Dinzwar Gefera](/macropedia/dinzwar-gefera) was reportedly able to weather the disasters that marked the downfall of the Imperium.
