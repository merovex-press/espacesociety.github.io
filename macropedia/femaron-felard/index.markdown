Also known as the Bloody Pretender.

Femaron Felard was born to a family of [[Normalized Anthorph](/macropedia/normalized-anthorph)](/macropedia/normalized-anthorph)s, and from early childhood was raised with a deep hatred of [Anthorph](/macropedia/anthorph)s.  In the years after the death of [Emperor Jubal IV](/macropedia/jubal-four) and the ascension of [Durin Bonish](/macropedia/durin-bonish) as the first Premiere during the [Imperial Interregnum](/macropedia/imperial-interregnum), FemaronÂ’s family had attempted a number of unsuccessful uprisings against the Imperium, and were finally forced to flee beyond the Imperium.

Femaron returned to the Imperium under the guise of a wealthy merchant and ingratiated himself with the last, weaker Premiers that succeeded [Durin Bonish](/macropedia/durin-bonish).  He also took under his wing the remnants of the [Bafiktuy Intelligence Directive](/macropedia/bafiktuy-intelligence-directive), and brilliantly played all sides against each other, until he finally felt the time right and seized power.  He briefly reigned as a Premiere, mouthing the vows to leave the throne to the Imperial House, all the while preparing for his ultimate goal.

In a bold move, using a cadre of informers, spies and assassins, he murdered hundreds (some say even thousands) of members of noble families and high ranking merchants, and declared himself Emperor through a fictitous genealogy linking him to the [Tawmerik Dynasty](/macropedia/tawmerik-dynasty).  His hatred of [Anthorph](/macropedia/anthorph)s was made clear as he set about on a series of horrifying purges known as the [Hundred Bloody Days](/macropedia/hundred-bloody-days), murdering Anthorph leaders, jailing sympathizers and placing hundreds of thousands on a number of prison worlds.

His reign of terror became so horrible that finally even those among his associates who shared his anti-Anthorph bigotry could no longer stand by and watch.  On the eve of Famaron signing an Imperial Proclamation ordering the execution of all [Anthorph](/macropedia/anthorph)s in Imperium space, his own guard assassinated him.

The death of the Bloody Pretender Femaron Felard is generally marked as the final collapse of the Imperium.
