**Migar Comm** is the standard computer of the Imperium citizen, and are a healthy alternative to embedded computers. The migar comm is used primarily as a personal assistant, storing millions of pages of information, capable of accessing [ether](/macropedia/ether) libraries. They also allow citizens to contact one another via video [ether](/macropedia/ether) conference (the "Videcon").

By the middle of the Imperium, [Fully Autonomous Data Acquisition Personalities](/macropedia/f-ad-ap) were possible, allowing a more enriched interaction with the computer.

Typically, the low-end versions of these computers communicate to their owner by the small screen on the device itself, although a popular version allows projection to a surface allowing for screen sizes of up to three meters. Higher end units combine with implanted cornea and cochlea to provide a rich audio/visual experience similar to that provided by [SMEE](/macropedia/s-me-e).
