The **Imudring** represents one of the more curious cultures in the
Imperium. To accept their version of history, those belonging to this
group originally belonged to one of the sleeper ships allegedly launched
from [Sol System](/star-systems/sol-system) during the [Chronology/Emergence](/chronology/emergence). Starship
engineers seem to support the notion as the ships the Imudring inhabit
are engineered in a very odd way and have a significantly different line
of design than most trans-system ships, with notable exception of FTL
drives. During the [[Terran Decline](/macropedia/terran-decline)](/chronology/first-decline), the
Imudring were separated, and most were forced to scratch a meager
existance in space.

Regardless of their source, the Imudring were the only group of people
who have refused to touch planetary soil in recorded history. They were
masters of space travel. Unfortunately, their ships tended to have a
lack of gravity, so risks of gravity prevented them from landing on any
body with significant gravity. However, small asteroids were still a
possibility, yet they still refused to set foot on anything not a ship.

The Imudring ships formed the backbone of trans-system cargo transport
during most of the Imperium. Various corporations and Imperial
organizations had their own cargo transport, but the most reliable and
common were the Imudring. Speculation suggests that part of this is
because their ships are fitted with heavy weapons and that Imudring
ships may neutralize competition when possible. However, there are no
substantiated claims to these accusations.

One of the more perplexing is their early adoption of the
[Hagurin Character Set](/macropedia/hagurin-character-set), even to the point of seeming to abandon their
native writing. What makes this more perplexing is the fact that there
are different factions of Imudring, many of whom are in open-hostility
with one another. (Which, also, makes them interesting considering their
supposed business practices.)

The Imudring are also fairly strict adherants to the [Chogia Faith](/macropedia/chogia-faith), which
is a meditative discipline involving the manual writing of the
[Hagurin Character Set](/macropedia/hagurin-character-set).

In response to outside pressures and internal conflict, the Imudring
attempted a brief federation but ill-fated under [Wecing Doozium](/macropedia/wecing-doozium), an infamous trader.
