Not that this period lacked conflict, but that such conflicts were on a lower, easier-to-manage scale, as opposed to system-wide general war. During this period, the [anthorph](/macropedia/anthorph) security firms, such as the [Dinzwar Gefera](/macropedia/dinzwar-gefera), and non-anthroph firms like the [Gesceamian Choent](/macropedia/gesceamian-choent) were established and grew considerably.
