The **Novya Siberian-Belshani War** was a rather minor war with significant results. Novya Siberia was a staunchly independent system that had not kept up with the same technological advances as some of the other systems. In a similar situation was the [[Star Systems](/macropedia/star-systems)/Belshane](/star-systems/belshane). Both were technologically inferior to many of the other systems, but roughly equal in power.

Quite clearly, the Belshane wanted to extend their power base. With the [Terran Republic](/macropedia/terran-republic) forming, the chance to do so was beginning to dwindle. They sent several warships to the [Novya Siberia](/star-systems/novya-siberia) System and demanded surrender. [Veltrane Fres Volon](/macropedia/veltrane-fres-volon) led the Novya-Siberians at the time, and has been called one of the most dynamic and hard-headed leaders in their history. Even without a significant battle fleet of his own, he responded to the threat with a surprise attack that met with outstanding results.

Over the next few years, each side launched attacks against the other, slowly destroying their economies. With one exception, the Battle of Belshani-Yassa, the Belshani lost every significant military engagement. Consequently, most of their efforts focused on attacking intra-system travel within [Novya Siberia](/star-systems/novya-siberia). The Siberians in-turn adopted convey tactics to thwart the commerce raiders.

Eventually, the two sides had pummelled one another to near ruin. The two sides entered into a cease fire. [Veltrane Fres Volon](/macropedia/veltrane-fres-volon), who denigrated the Terran Republic then turned to that Republic for security. The Belshane Clans refused to enter the Republic as a result. However, Republican enthusiasts within the common ranks protested and staged strikes until the Clans relented. As if to underscore the shame of the union, the Republic formally admitted [[Star Systems](/macropedia/star-systems)/Belshane](/star-systems/belshane) exactly five years after admitting [Novya Siberia](/star-systems/novya-siberia).
