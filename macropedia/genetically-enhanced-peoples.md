Generally, the term "Genetically Enhanced Peoples" refers specifically to [Anthorph](/macropedia/anthorph)s and other closely related peoples in populated space.  The [Anthorph](/macropedia/anthorph)s are a genetically diverse people that are bound by some similiarities in culture, custom and faith.

There have been other populations of genetically enhanced peoples that are generally not classified as being [Anthorph](/macropedia/anthorph)s.  Many of these are descendants of pre-Anthorph experiments, particularly during the [First Expanse](/chronology/first-expanse).  There are records of many such experiments from this earliest period of space travel.  So-called Belters that lived in the rocky asteroid belt of the Terran system were said to have had alterations done to make living for extended periods in zero-g environments easier.  The descendants of these Belters still live today, most not having stood on a planetary surface in millennia.

There are rumors that the [Imudring](/macropedia/imudring) also experimented upon themselves.  The secretive Imudring will refuse to answer such questions, though it is at least a possible explanation as to why incidents of interbreeding between Imudring and other human types is almost unheard of.
