The **Cel-Tainu Astrophysical Reasearch Corporation** (CARC, or Celtainu) was formed by two [Helsmunt Institute](/macropedia/helsmunt-institute) graduates. Phurnando Letalles and and Hugau-bmilanoj Stepivan Shersite d'Mibashura. Stepivan had worked on his post-doctorate in Branespace forcasting when he discovered an old, defunct, and non-operational astrogation computer and its storehouse. He recruited his wealthy roommate Phurnando to smuggle the computer out of the institute and to a remote part of the planet.

Stepivan earned his degree, while Phurnando had facilities built to restore the computer. They reverse engineered the system, and built a replacement computer [Dio En Mashino](/macropedia/dio-en-mashino) using emerging technologies. When [Dio En Mashino](/macropedia/dio-en-mashino) was activated, they quickly realized the original computer was one of the major astrogation computers from prior to the [First Decline](/chronology/first-decline).

Dr. Letalles spent the remainder of his career validating the route formulae while Stepivan built CARC's business out of restoring them. Their efforts helped enable the major colonies to re-establish trade and communication. 

However, the [Helsmunt Institute](/macropedia/helsmunt-institute) suied to recover the original computer. The Institute settled out of court when they were offered a ten percent ownership of CARC, which made them a comfortable but silent partner. Eventually, the Imperium nationalized the CARC and turned it into the Ministry for Transportation. This gave the imperium a virtual monopoly over intersteller routes.

The negotiator for the out-of-court settlement was none other than [Benita Perez](/macropedia/benita-perez), who earned ten percent of the Institutes winnings. With this windfall, she sought to retire peacefully. However, she served as a catalyst for the formation of the new repubic. She eventually assumed she had a knack for politics and was astonished when she won her first seat and was soon after elected to prime minister.
