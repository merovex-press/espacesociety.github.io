This is from an email I sent out in April to the main list giving a rough timeline of the formation and fall of the [Terran Republic](/macropedia/terran-republic).

----

Well, my [Reth Tawmerik I](/macropedia/reth-tawmerik-i) article states that good ol' [Reth](/macropedia/reth-tawmerik-i) was
instrumental in getting the Republic formed, and we've established
almost since the beginning that [Reth](/macropedia/reth-tawmerik-i) with his buddy [Alistair Cormwite](/macropedia/alistair-cormwite)
were responsible for its demise.

We know that:

- The philosopher and journalist [Janoos Welkred](/macropedia/janoos-welkred) was instrumental in at
least elucidating the idea of a [Terran Republic](/macropedia/terran-republic) as a way of bringing
together humanity after the long period of isolation during the [First Decline](/chronology/first-decline).

- [Reth Tawmerik](/macropedia/reth-tawmerik-i) was an important supporter of the Republican movement,
and as a member of a very important family from the [Imperial Core Worlds](/macropedia/imperial-core-worlds)
must have had a great deal of influence on convincing other powerful
interests to back it.

- [Reth](/macropedia/reth-tawmerik-i) is also the first Prime Minister, though he only remains in that
position for a year, before becoming Minister of Defense for some
indeterminate amount of time.

- We also know that [Reth Tawmerik](/macropedia/reth-tawmerik-i), after capturing [Messen Fremezulejo](/macropedia/messen-fremezulejo),
seems to have had a change of heart.  This seems to be an area where
scholars differ :-), as at least [Chang Singh](/scholar/chang-singh) thinks that Reth actually
planned all along to produce a weak republic that would collapse and
deliver him power.

- The [Alaerian Cult](/macropedia/alaerian-cult) explodes on to the scene during this period, but
because the [Frontier Rebellion](/macropedia/frontier-rebellion) doesn't happen until [Reth](/macropedia/reth-tawmerik-i) has already
become Emperor, that its direct effect on the Republic couldn't be
anything but relatively minor.

- ... Some period of time (probably 20 years or so) passes ...

- [Benita Perez](/macropedia/benita-perez) becomes last Prime Minister, but is politically naive
and in a weak position, and Reth seizes power with the help of [Cormwite](/macropedia/alistair-cormwite)
(and, I'm sure, other very powerful factions).
