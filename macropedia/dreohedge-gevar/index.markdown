The *Dreohedge Gevar* was a special research vessel used by [Klister University](/macropedia/klister-university) to solve many of the Creator's tests regarding [jump drives](/natural-sciences/brane-hopping) and other technology. Originally commissioned during the reign of [Lendth Tawmerik](/macropedia/lendth-tawmerik), the *Dreohedge Gevar* quickly evolved a profusion of both [brane-hopping](/natural-sciences/brane-hopping) and slower-than-light modifications. It is the only vessel ever to have clearly recorded a recovery from a hop error. 

As incidents and experiments began to collect in the history of the vessel, it developed quite a reputation as a sturdy and "lucky" ship. A heavily modified [[Parthas Class Vessel](/macropedia/parthas-class-vessel)](/macropedia/parthas-class-vessels) it had several redundant command, computation, and control centers to handle the extra drives and mofications sensibly. When the ship actually managed to recover from a bad hop, its reputation took on legendary proportions.

During that incident, the *Gevar* made a hop from the University to the [Fasantauri System](/macropedia/fasantauri-system). It failed to properly gain normal space and was only visible in the direction of Fasantauri itself. One of the most famous video recordings in history was shot by a small [Cathian Navy](/macropedia/cathian-navy) scout. The recording starts with a fully visible shot from the bow of the ship. Crewmembers are clearly visible in the ports. The scout then executes a roughly circular maneuver over the dorsal side of the *Gevar* which becomes increasingly transparent during the process. Almost 7 hours after the incident, the *Gevar* hopped again and properly gained space back in its home system. Analysis of the incident later lead to the conclusion that such a recovery was very unlikely to be possible, and only the result of the special circumstances surrounding the ship to begin with.

After participation in the [Popelof Project](/macropedia/popelof-project), the *Gevar* has vanished. It has been declared lost, carrying with it a copy of one of the greates stores of knowledge in human history.
