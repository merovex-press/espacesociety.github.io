Imperium government ministry, founded out of the merger of a number of departments by [Temba II](/macropedia/temba-two) as part of his sweeping plans to produce a galactic culture.  Given a vast budget, its purpose was to finance and manage various cultural projects such as theaters, symphonies, museums and fairs.

Within a few generations the Ministry had become a place for Emperors and politicians to stick patronage appointees.  Its large budget often ended up either being spent on ill-conceived projects or outright misappropriated by directors.

Part of the [Grand Reforms](/macropedia/grand-reforms) was a major overhaul of the Ministry, which was delivered from the hands of patronage appointees.  Those reforms were relatively shortlived, and the Ministry was finally abolished by Premiere [Hjans Kreb Lakol](/macropedia/hjans-kreb-lakol), its budget redirected directly into the Premiere's office.
