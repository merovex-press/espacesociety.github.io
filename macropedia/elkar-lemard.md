Elkar Lemard initiated the eponymous [Lemardian Movement](/macropedia/lemardians). As a prominent member of the [Sevyet](/macropedia/imperial-congress) and a well-known geneticist, Lemard maintained a fair amount of public attention.

Lemard was of [Genetically Enhanced](/macropedia/genetically-enhanced-peoples) descent, from a desert world. His lean countenance provided him with an air of authority among unenhanced humans. His people enjoy an extended lifespan and traditionally kept a lifestyle of having two consecutive carreers. In his first carreer, Lemard gained prestige by passing many of the creators tests, particular in the area of xeno-botanical hybridization.

Lemard served part of this carreer as an officer in the [Frontier Scout Fleet](/macropedia/frontier-scout-fleet). Not only did this lead to common falsehood that he was involved with the discovery of [Esperopteris Koinsii](/macropedia/esperopteris-koinsii), but it later served popular conspiracy theorists with "evidence" that he was a member of the supposed [Hilkedge Light Horse](/macropedia/last-charge-of-light-horse) secret society.

As his second carreer, Lemard became a politician. His letters and writings from this period seem to indicate that he genuinely believed that politicians and the public just needed to understand things better. Unfortunately, when he started making a point of fostering skeptical education and seperating mythology from fact in education, he made many enemies among the [Kuberians](/macropedia/kuberian-movement). As his conflict with them intensified, he made increasingly pointed speaches, and started garnering much support from the scientific and military communities. Reluctantly, he found himself the founder of a counter-movement to the [Kuberians](/macropedia/kuberian-movement), a position he did not want.

Lemard and the early [Lemardians](/macropedia/lemardians) put up with much annoyance and interferance from the [BID](/macropedia/bafiktuy-intelligence-directive) for several years before their influence stabilized and then later declined. Lemard died peacefully almost 20 standard years after retiring from public life. He is revered as an *exemplar* by the followers of [Qin Lop Shu](/macropedia/qin-lop-shu).
