The Sino-East Slavic Treaty League was a major political body on old Earth before the [First Decline](/chronology/first-decline). It comprised most of the area of the largest continent on Terra. My own researchs on Terra have failed to reveal a formation date for the League, but some sources seemed to indicate that the League formed over several generations, and thus, perhaps, was not viewed as having a single formation date. While the SESTL did rule a large area it should be noted that most of the area was wilderness, in particular desert and wasteland. While the sources I discovered did not directly mention it, they appeared to view environmental neglect as a historical feature of the SESTL and its "member states". Indeed, much of the source material we have for the SESTL seems to indicate that by the time of the [First Expanse](/chronology/first-expanse), it was already in grave trouble, with dense populations concentrated on its Eastern coast and its Western border.

The SESTL is deserving of mention here, because a great deal of evidence seem to indicate that it was the source of a large portion, if not the majority, of the colonization movement. In particular, they appear to have spent a great deal of their energy building a vast "slowboat" colonization fleet using ramscoop technology and boosted out of the [Solar System](/star-systems/sol-system) by the first primitive drive laser installations. Thus, the culture(s) of this body are the source for many of the similarities of cultures, languages, and government that occur throughout the [Jiao Banner Sphere](/macropedia/jiao-banner-sphere). Indeed, I suspect that they were the source culture for many of the [Genetically Enhanced Peoples](/macropedia/genetically-enhanced-peoples). The extent to which this is true is not clearly evident at this time, and so this remains an intriguing theory.
