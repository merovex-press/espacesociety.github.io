## Overview

[Ether](/macropedia/ether)-based [A Is](/macropedia/a-is) developed to search, collect and collate information from various public networks.  Due to security concerns and a general fears about [A Is](/macropedia/a-is) in general, strict laws on the capacity of [F Ad Aps](/macropedia/f-ad-aps) were passed.

## General Features of [F Ad Aps](/macropedia/f-ad-aps)

[F Ad Aps](/macropedia/f-ad-aps) are actually marvels of programming.  The best of them can transverse numerous types of networks, adapt themselves to various operating systems and architectures by ingenious means of self-adaption.  While early [F Ad Aps](/macropedia/f-ad-aps) were usually strictly limited, abuse was natural, and on many occasions high-security and private networks were penetrated.

[F Ad Aps](/macropedia/f-ad-aps) don't necessarily have to be the most intelligent [A Is](/macropedia/a-is).  In fact, a key trait of any successful "species" of [F Ad Aps](/macropedia/f-ad-aps) is a relatively small footprint, thus allowing for faster access to networks.

Some individual [F Ad Aps](/macropedia/f-ad-aps) are centuries old.  One FADAP, sadly destroyed during the [Hundred Bloody Days](/macropedia/hundred-bloody-days), was called Ernie Eleven, and claimed to have dated back to the [First Expanse](/chronology/first-expanse).

## Security Concerns

During the reign of [Quanna Dabrian II](/macropedia/qanna-dabrian-two), a particularly self-adaptive species of [F Ad Aps](/macropedia/f-ad-aps) was developed by at [Klister University](/macropedia/klister-university).  This species soon began evolve at a rapid rate, able to pierce everything from portable wrist-worn [[Migar Comm](/macropedia/migar-comm)](/macropedia/migar-comm) computers to interstellar vessels.  It was never truly brought under control, and has propogated itself on the [Ether](/macropedia/ether) ever since.

Finally, the [Imperial Congress](/macropedia/imperial-congress) passed a series of laws banning highly-adaptive [F Ad Aps](/macropedia/f-ad-aps), forcing programmers to put programmed signatures on all [F Ad Aps](/macropedia/f-ad-aps) and instituting an entire department to monitoring [F Ad Aps](/macropedia/f-ad-aps).  Naturally, this has not prevented abuse.  Security companies, and even government-based agencies, regularly flaunt the rules.

Of greatest concern for security experts and ethicists are the very new technologies allowing for a whole new class of [F Ad Aps](/macropedia/f-ad-aps), the [Imprinted Personality](/macropedia/imprinted-personality).
