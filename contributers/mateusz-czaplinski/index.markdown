I'm just a tiny Wikignome here. Interested in the world and it's development, and watching it since it's very first days on the [FudgeList](http://fudge.phoenyx.net), yet not having enough inventiveness nor time to add anything big into the Project.

## Editing notes
* 
* *This is the talk page of FOOBAR article.*
*
* **Cross-group links:** @@[=Macropedia/OdniPlanyeti=]@@ shows as Macropedia/OdniPlanyeti, whilst @@[=Macropedia.OdniPlanyeti=]@@ as Macropedia.OdniPlanyeti.
** One-word links, such as @@Heljyks@@, still need to be linkified by enclosing in @@[=[[=]@@s and @@[=]]=]@@s anyway: @@[=[Macropedia/Heljyks](/macropedia/heljyks)=]@@ shows as [Macropedia/Heljyks](/macropedia/heljyks).
* **Categories:** @@[==]@@ shows all pages of category [=PhantomImperiumEdition=] (that is, linking to [=Category/PhantomImperiumEdition=]), whilst @@[==]@@ shows all sub-pages of page/group Category.
* **Linking-to** articles can be printed by using: @@[==]@@

## Links
Here I suppose I'll store some [world](/contributers/macropedia) links I find especially interesting. (The link comments below are not meant to be very deep - just a simple reference, useful for me at least.)
* [Macropedia/Heljyks](/macropedia/heljyks) - ye space pirates! :)
* Macropedia/OdniPlanyeti - is it the only starsystem/planet here now?!?
* [Liu-No-Ri Masters](/macropedia/liu-no-ri-masters) - kinda monks, who spawned from one of Macropedia/DinzwarGefera mercenaries groups.
* [Macropedia/Zenbrudi](/macropedia/zenbrudi) - horrible aliens; and is it *really* truth that *all* of them were killed?...
