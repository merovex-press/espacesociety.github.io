# Computers



## Overview

Computers are an omni-present tool in E-Space. Some computers have attained sentience, while others were kept hobbled or designed to harness great processing power on process intensive endeavors.

## History

Computers accompanied Terrans into space from the very beginning.

## Specialties

Regardless of how complex computers grow throughout E-Space, there remains the need to have computers specialized in certain tasks. This section will discuss the various specialty computers.

Beginning during the early Emergence Era, some top-end computers reached a pseudo-sentience. As technology progressed, it became aparent that there were limits to how intelligent a computer so designed was capable of becomming.

Computer processing power is an extension of a society's ability to build and maintain. The table to the left helps describe the limitations of artificial intelligence during the different periods of E-Space history. The limitation describes the processing power of  the typical top-end computer, as it compares to human intelligence.
