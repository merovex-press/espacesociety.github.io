E-Space is a [firm-Science Fiction](/main/grading-sci-fi) RPG setting, grounded in the Fudge RPG gaming engine, but designed to allow players from other gaming systems enjoy. E-space seeks to cover the gambit of human interaction throughout outer space. We want to offer a solid enough framework to allow individual [=GMs=] and authors to create worlds and campaigns that integrate together, without stepping on anybody's toes too much.
