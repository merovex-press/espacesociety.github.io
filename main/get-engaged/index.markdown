What do I mean by get engaged? I'm a budding novelist. In the mid-2000s, myself and two other intrepid authors wrote a series of mock encyclopedia articles on this site, which became the [Macropedia/](/macropedia/). Since then, I've plotted two novels and am presently drafting one. My goal is to have one or both of the novels out by June 2011. 
Since 2007, I have been fairly active on Astro Empires; though presently I'm forced to focus on family and the books. So, think of this as a way to help get a fellow player's efforts out there!

I will give a free ebook of the first released novel to anybody following me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/merovex) in the first month of its release. My main web site [Dausha Communications](http://dausha.net) tracks my progress and provides a way for you to comment on entries and get involved.

I might even need you to help me proof the book and find issues with it. Anybody who does I'll put in the acknowledgements.
