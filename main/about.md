Everyspace Society was a group of authors who met on the Internet wanting to build a Sci-Fi milieu. We started talking about about successful rules-light commercial settings, and felt that [Fudge RPG](http://www.fudgerpg.com/) lacked a Science Fiction setting. The scope of Every Space was to provide enough coverage through time and space to encompass most SF genre trends.

Eventually, the three of us created the [Macropedia/Macropedia](/macropedia/macropedia), which was a fictitious, mock wikipedia about a future society. We were Scholars at the collapse of the Imperium trying to summarize our society and the cause of its collapse.

As of 2010, the site is fairly dormant, though we are looking for new authors to join us. Aaron has worked on a few short stories, and Ben is stuck on a rough draft for a novel set in the Terradoma. And, of course, the original Macropedia Terradoma has been released in [hardcopy](/macropedia/imperium-edition-printed).

The original authors were:

* [~AaronClausen](/main/~aaron-clausen)
* [~JohnUghrin](/main/~john-ughrin)
* [~BenWilson](/main/~ben-wilson)
