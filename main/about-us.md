Everyspace Society
==================

The Everyspace collaborative Sci-Fi milieu grew from the Fudge RPG's lack of a setting of this type. The material is suitable for stand-along campaigns and fiction writing.

Because of its Sci-Fi nature, Everyspace became a home for popular [Astro Empires](http://www.astroempires.com) guides. Some aspects of AE's game cross-pollinated with E-Space in interesting ways.

Everyspace is also the milieu source for some novels in Ben Wilson's [Pax Imperium Terradoma](http://www.dausha.net/Books) series.
