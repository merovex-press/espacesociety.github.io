## Overview
Zebrathan 8 is an orange star with the spectra K5.  It is the only star in the system.

## Planets

### Dannus

<dl><dt>Gravity%25dlstar%25</dt><dd> Superb</dd>
<dt>Habitat</dt><dd> Terrible</dd>
<dt>Colony</dt><dd> Terrible</dd>
<dt>Resources</dt><dd> Terrible</dd>
</dl>

A brown dwarf orbiting at only .5au.  Likely a captured object, it may have had satellites, but all are lost due to intense tidal effects with the primary.

### Zebrathan

The only habitable world in the system, a few scientific missions early in the Imperium indicated that it may have initially been an satellite of Dannus and was swept away from the brown dwarf and into an eccentric orbit of its own.  Large ice caps are likely all that is left of what was once a planet-wide glacier system that melted some three hundred million standard years ago (about the time that Dannus was captured by the primary.

### Reth

</dl>

A frozen desert world, there is evidence that it once had liquid oceans and a thick atmosphere, but seems to have been pushed to an orbit beyond which liquid water can exist. 

### Tirimus

</dl>

A gas giant with over a dozen moons.  Some of these moons are rocky cored and have useful quantities of ores.

## History
Scout expeditions during the reign of [Reth I](/macropedia/reth-tawmerik-i) found a habitable system, and there were a few half-hearted colonial missions, but other than a few populations of semi-nomadic sheep herders and a single space port servicing the mines on Reth and the moons of Tirimus, it was too distant from major hop routes to ever receive any attention.

This half-forgotten corner of the Imperium would return to interest when the first reigning Premiere, Macropedia/DurinBonish, sold the entire system to the Macropedia/PerkentovCovenent.  Records indicate that nearly eight million Perkentov followers abandoned the Imperium for this distant system.  Most of what is known comes from the descendants of the original colonists who, finding the leaders of the Macropedia/PerkentovCovenent domineering and intolerable, fled their homes.

By all accounts the Perkentov society has become a tyrannical one, with the leadership becoming oppressive.  The failing Imperium made some noise about cleaning up affairs, but even before the reign of the pretender Macropedia/FemaronFelard, the system was part of the Imperium only on paper.
