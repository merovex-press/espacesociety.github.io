The Al Aidra system is most famous for being the last major outpost of the Macropedia/TaoSunni religion. It was Known to Terrans as [=HR5568=]. The system has four "stars", although the last barely counts.

## The Diaspora

The Al Aidra system was colonized early in the Chronology/FirstExpanse, miraculously, this appears to have been by ramscoop-driven slowboats. A few later colonists arrived hot on their heels.

## First Decline

The First Decline struck Al Aidra very harshly, especially so since the system had very few biotic resources to aid the colonists. Originally composed of settlers from several different groups. Only the Tao-Sunnis survived, likely due to their strict dietary and social regimens during this period. Populations stabilized at relatively low levels.

## Imperium Era

The return of interstellar travel was a boom and doom. The Macropedia/TaoSunni s were eventually overwhelmed by colonists seeking the system's mineral wealth and tourism as their religion experienced a fashionable period.

## Quadruple Stars

The stars in the system were named Al Aidra, Yin, Yang, Al Anuhm

## Worlds orbiting Al Aidra

Al Aidra is a [=K2V=] star. Orange and not very exciting.

### Ashkuten

<dt>Habitat</dt><dd> Good</dd>
<dt>Colony</dt><dd> Mediocre to Fair</dd>

</dl>

Ashkuten is the only planet to support life directly in the system. It is the home of the Macropedia/TaoSunni colonists. It was mined extensively in the Imperium Era for its extensive Jade deposits.


### Azeriin

<dt>Habitat</dt><dd> NA</dd>
<dt>Colony</dt><dd> NA</dd>
<dt>Resources</dt><dd> Poor</dd>
</dl>

Azeriin is a small, icy giant. It is white from the ice clouds in its upper atmosphere. For whatever reason, it has a small army of rocks in orbit, but none have proven worth mining against the danger of navigating the field.

## Worlds orbiting Yin

Yin is an [=M1V=] star. Red and very cool

### Chiro

<dt>Habitat</dt><dd> Terrible</dd>
<dt>Colony</dt><dd> None</dd>
<dt>Resources</dt><dd> Terrible</dd>
</dl>

Chiro is pretty to look at, but it is a small world with almost no atmosphere above its frozen acidic surface.


## Worlds orbiting Yang

Yang is an [=M3V=] star. Red and even cooler than Yin. There are no planetary bodies of appreciable size orbiting Yang.

## Worlds orbiting Al Anuhm

Al Anuhm is a [=T8=] star. It barely qualifies as a star, with a surface temp less than 1000 K. 

### Dehl Krauum belt

<dt>Habitat</dt><dd> Terrible</dd>
<dt>Colony</dt><dd> None-Terrible</dd>
<dt>Resources</dt><dd> Mediocre</dd>
</dl>

The Dehl Krauum belt has little to offer. Occasional temporary mining colonies struck up over the course of the Imperium, but were often abandoned.
